                <p>Luna followed the scuttling droid, grimacing at her soggy socks with every step. It was incredible, in a way, to be walking through the maintenance tunnels of a habitat ring… But she really should have followed Chanam’s advice to forgo casual wear, although she’d never let him know that.</p>

                <p>“What is this stuff, anyways? It’s too viscous to be water.” Luna muttered.</p>

                <p>“Semi-conductive nutrient slurry.” The droid, HK-9002, answered. “A means of attracting, sequestering, and tracking pests that may have made it on the station.” Luna opened her mouth to ask something, but the droid beat her to it. “Pest such as rats and roaches are good at finding vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities are found and addressed, we recycle the pests to use as fertilizer, emergency rations, or more of this nutrient slurry.”</p>

                <p>“I still can’t get over how you can anticipate what I’m going to say.” Luna huffed, looking behind her to make sure they weren’t being followed.</p>

                <p>“We are not being followed. And I apologize. There are some organics, like you, who are not quite used to communicating with my kind.” The droid stopped at a set of doors for but a moment before they opened.</p>

                <p>“AI?”</p>

                <p>HK-9002 rose on its hind legs, its three lenses focusing on her before waving her through the door.</p>

                <p>“Please do not call us that. Most of us would understand that, as a person who has not been a part of society for over a millennium, you are unaware of the weight of that word. It is the combined equivalent of calling humans cattle. Lesser even than the base apes your ancestors descend from.” Luna took a step from the lit tunnel into the dark shaft, eyes avoiding the droid’s.</p>

                <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

                <p>“I know.” The robot nodded as the door slowly closed behind them. “We prefer the term Constructed Intelligence, although some even prefer Constructed Consciousness, arguing that our less aware brethren may glitch into intelligence. Nevertheless, the idea that our consciousness, our intelligence is less real, less defined than that of organics has been a point of contention. There is a dark history behind the leap from artificial intelligence to constructed intelligence…one that resulted in the deaths of myriad nascent colonies. I was made centuries after those wars, but there are still some that remember those times…and even fewer, hidden in the reaches of known space, which seek to eradicate all organic life.” The door closed with a thrumming click and hiss, leaving Luna shivering in pitch darkness.</p>

                <p>A light sparked from the droid’s head, illuminating the small tunnel. HK-9002 had to walk on all six of its legs once more, though Luna only had to hunch over a bit.</p>

                <p>“There will be a ladder at the end, which will allow us to climb up to the top of the ring and walk back to the center to take the emergency maintenance passage. Very few people have the right to be here.” HK-9002 noted.</p>

                <p>“I guess there are benefits to hanging around a Ranger.”</p>

                <p>“More than you know, especially with the caliber of the Ranger that accompanies you.”</p>

                <p>“I knew there were ranks!” Luna pumped a fist. “Why else would Phinn be so abrasive to Chanam?”</p>

                <p>“Officially, no. All Rangers have equal weight when it comes to directing missions, unless explicitly told by Command. The reason Ranger Phinn was so abrasive was because he has something to prove as one of few cetacean rangers. He fears any accomplishments will be attributed to Chanam. With good reason; if he were to push for there to a be a leader on this mission, Command would likely nominate Chanam due to his seniority. Phinn’s presence here is mostly political too, hoping to convince the locals to vote for an aquatic habitat ring for his kin by proving his competence.”</p>

                <p>“Seriously?” Luna looked behind her as she tried to casually shake some goop out of her shoes.</p>

                <p>“Yes. It is my duty to assess the psychological profiles of individuals on board. This fiasco is partly my fault, thus why I am here with you and the Rangers.” HK-9002’s head flashed a small red light next to one of its lenses. Then, the droid pointed to the wall in front of Luna, which whirred to open several slots, acting as a ladder.</p>

                <p>Luna frowned and stared directly at HK-9002.</p>

                <p>“Pirates are holding the relay hostage. How is that your fault?” She started to climb.</p>

                <p>“I was lacking in my duties. I found their agent. I knew he was hiding something. From the information I could gather I assumed it was adultery. I put him on a low priority watchlist. He manipulated accepted RFID tag logs so that their ships could approach while posing as friendly ships.”</p>

                <p>“But — ” Luna looked down from the ladder to HK-9002, who didn’t need the ladder to climb, preferring instead to use its synthetic limbs to climb up the side.</p>

                <p>“This is not the safe, enclosed environment of a planet. This is a relay orbiting a sun over an asteroid field. The nearest habitable planet is lightyears away. There are checks upon checks upon checks. Failsafes for failsafes. Everybody on this ship has a duty. Mistakes by any one party could grow into life-threatening disasters that affect the whole station. Even if we succeed, I can expect dire consequences.” The droid climbed past Luna and offered her help from the ladder to the upper tunnel. Luna looked at his three-fingered silicone hand and felt her heart leap in her throat.</p>

                <p>“Consequences?” Luna could see her breath in HK-9002’s light.</p>

                <p>“Remedial classes and reduced vacation time. Plus, my shame modules going into overdrive.” There was an obvious mirthful tone in the artificial voice. It knew that she feared for them.</p>

                <p>Luna laughed with the droid and grabbed their hand so she could be pulled across the gap. A thought occurred.</p>

                <p>“You mentioned at the bar that the robot bodies you use are a bit like suits you have to wear for a job. If you’re not really here, aren’t you afraid of being hacked? Especially with the important roles A — I mean, CI’s play in keeping the relay running.”</p>

                <p>“Are you?” Luna raised an eyebrow to look at the lumbering droid. “I have logs. Should there be a change to my programming, core or otherwise, someone will notice. However, as an organic, you are vulnerable to propaganda, biases, and fallacies. You could be convinced to work against your best interests without even leaving a data trail. Consider chemical or neural manipulation as well. We are all vulnerable to different things. It is our duty as a community to recognize and address these factors. The whole is greater — ”</p>

                <p>“ — than the sum of our parts, yeah.” Luna interrupted. “I’ve heard that before.”</p>

                <p>“As you should. It is one of the philosophical pillars of the Joint Terran Governments, and of the United Governments of Humanity before it. Speaking of which…” The CI shined a light on a thick pillar embedded through the ceiling and floor. Another flash of red on HK-9002’s head, and the pillar opened. The light turned to glare in Luna’s face and she squinted and tried to block the beam. “Your file says you have no biological enhancements, and that among the restitution given for the events surrounding the Odyssey, you were given a neural interface. Are there any conditions or upgrades I should be aware of?”</p>

                <p>“Umm…Chanam did get me a ‘skeletal improvement solution’ to take regularly, but he hasn’t exactly told me how it works.”</p>

                <p>“Are you or have you ever been pregnant?”</p>

                <p>“No? Shouldn’t that be in my file?” Luna frowned.</p>

                <p>“One can never be too sure.” HK-9002 shrugged. “Has Chanam taught you anything about breathing in high G’s?”</p>

                <p>“He didn’t need to…wait. Aren’t there inertial dampeners?” An icy pit began to form in Luna’s stomach.</p>

                <p>“We must be covert. We will break through the centrifugal force of the habitat ring and get to the main body of the relay.” The droid walked into the pillar and laid down, their limbs splitting apart and locking into divots inside the pillar as treads set themselves in place. “Now please lay where my chest cavity has opened up.”</p>

                <p>True to their word, their chest opened to take the shape of a seat, with silicone gel bracing where Luna’s joints, spine, and head would rest. Luna hesitated for a moment before grunting and getting in place. She could try to look up, but the tunnel seemed to reach into a dark eternity.</p>

                <p>“How many G’s should I expect?”</p>

                <p>“Please do not talk. 3.”</p>

                <p>Luna let out a sigh of relief.</p>

                <p>“2.” Luna’s eyes widened as she stiffened.</p>

                <p>“1. Liftoff.”</p>

                <p>All Luna could think of as she was pushed down into the droid’s frame was that it definitely was more than just three G’s.</p>

                <p>Mike Myers had been screaming in Paul’s ear for the past thirty-two hours. It didn’t matter that last time Paul checked, the Austin Powers star had been dead for eighteen years. However, like most Hollywood stars, his likeness, voice, and mannerisms existed virtually. He’d been in front of a camera long enough to be able to simulate any of his characters. Sadly, Mike wasn’t lucky enough to die after the development of Kur.</p>

                <p>So instead of being harassed by Mike Meyers himself, Paul had to contend with the unending screech of a simulacrum puppeted by a programmer with way too much time on their hands. Other afterlifers called such people trolls. Paul just called them jealous morons. If they spent half as much time concocting new and creative ways to make his afterlife worse…well, maybe they could earn enough to buy their own place in Kur.</p>

                <p>Paul had tried to report the entity, but it wasn’t a person. Sending complaints in the form of bug reports, sending emails asking for an administrator, and even lowering the volume were useless. Either Kur was not doing their jobs providing an optimal afterlife, or…they were ignoring him. Paul did not like being ignored, and his patience had long worn thin. That is how his journey through the afterlife began.</p>

                <p>Kur was named after the Mesopotamian afterlife, mostly because there was already a trademark on the other afterlives. In the old legends, Gilgamesh went on a journey to Kur to find the secret of immortality, only to eventually accept his mortality and pass on like a sucker. A man-made afterlife was easier to navigate; fast travel points existed throughout every server and hopping from one server to the other was done with two flicks of the wrist.</p>

                <p>Paul would pop in, relish in the few minutes of silence, then ask if there was an administrator nearby. Sometimes it was at a tranquil fisherman’s lake. Or a theme park. In a city of chrome and glass, a village of stone and hay. Paul interrupted a perfectly normal chess game, five dancing people surrounding a crying man, and many passionate lovers. There would be magic, or guns, or swords, or all of them, or none of them. Many mocked him when they recognized his situation. Some people tried to be helpful. Others pretended to be helpful. All of them were useless. Until Paul finally found what he was looking for.</p>

                <p>He appeared in a plane of bowling pins when he received a message in the telltale red text of an administrator. It simply read: “Hold on, I’m coming.”</p>

                <p>Paul opened his mouth to comment that he’d already been waiting long enough, and despite not being able to feel tired anymore, he felt the threads of his sanity unravelling. But for once, the response was quick. In a puff of smoke, she appeared. A woman draped in wispy white silks that moved and faded in a silent breeze, fluttering against a set of invisible wings that almost glimmered in the light behind her. She floated above the ground, fierce talons replacing feet. Her beautiful face was pale like a corpse’s, enshrined in a crown of writhing snakes and onyx hair, tainted only by the voids where her eyes should be. Paul had seen so many more interesting avatars, anyway. She wasn’t even in the top twenty.</p>

                <p>“Greetings player! It is I, Ereshkigal — ” She boomed.</p>

                <p>“Yeah, yeah.” Paul waved his hand. “Enough with the roleplay. Can I please talk to an administrator about my problem?”</p>

                <p>“…I am an admin.” Ereshkigal broke character, cocking her head.</p>

                <p>“No,” Paul chuckled, “You’re an actor. Not even a good one. Like those people at renaissance festivals. And administrators” he stressed the word, “are good enough with computers to recognize what is wrong with me.”</p>

                <p>“You probably need more than ‘someone good with computers’ to deal with your issues.” Ereshkigal muttered, swiping her hands in the air a few times, the yawning pits that were her eyes squinting over an unseen menu.</p>

                <p>“What do you mean by that?” Paul was curt, but firm. Maybe a bit loud, but that’s who he was. You didn’t become as successful as Paul by being soft-spoken!</p>

                <p>“Nothing~!” The roleplayer said in a sing-songy voice. “I think I see your problem.”</p>

                <p>“Do you?”</p>

                <p>Paul’s question was punctuated by Mike Myers reappearing, screaming his head off in a visceral screech that drilled into the ears of anybody listening. As per usual.</p>

                <p>“Oh yeah, that’s bad.” Ereshkigal waved her hands a few more times and smiled. “Much better.”</p>

                <p>Myers was still screaming.</p>

                <p>“He’s still here.”</p>

                <p>“Yeah, I just muted him on my end. Easier to concentrate.” She clasped her hands together. Even though she had no eyes, Paul felt like she was looking past him. “Okay, I can get rid of the screaming British dude. He is British, right?” Before Paul could respond, she continued. “Anyways, this is a decently made Trojan. Did you scam someone? The name of the file is literally ‘effyouscammer.exe’.”</p>

                <p>“Ridiculous.”</p>

                <p>“Yeah, well…it’s deeply embedded into your programming. We’ll have to do a full wipe.” Ereshkigal tutted. “Kinda mortifying to lose all your memories of your time here, but whatever.” </p>
                <p>Her shrug was casual, as if she didn’t see the expression on Paul’s face.</p>

                <p>“A wipe?! You can’t do that to me! I’m a paying customer!”</p>

                <p>“Relax, it’s like, your fifth time.” Her ice-cold hand patted him on the shoulder. “And your estate has been out of funds for about a century now.”</p>

                <p>Paul felt fuzzy, disconnected.</p>

                <p>“Yeah, keeping old afterlifers around is subsidized. It does wonders as a societal morale booster. Legally speaking, you’re not even human.”</p>

                <p>Paul tried to run, but his body was frozen in place. It would not obey him. His digital heart froze in terror. As the administrator approached him, she recited practiced PR lines in a sadistic grin.</p>

                <p>“We at Kur would like to thank you for your patronage. Because here, we make sure you rest in peace.”</p>

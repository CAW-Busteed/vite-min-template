                <p>Sun Auric was many things. A loyal son. A goldsmith. A scholar. A criminal. A revolutionary. He was not a man who prayed. The elves had Nai. The dwarves, Glish. The various reptid species had many gods above their revered dragons. But Sun, like all of humanity, had nothing to pray to.</p>

                <p>Publicly, humans were made to worship Nai, and a few might be sincere. Others prayed to Sol and Lun, in the wilds of the south, away from civilization. Sun had also heard tale of folk who lived deep beneath Arbora’s bark, who only whispered Her name on their lips before they went to sleep in their lightless tunnels. But there was no god for humans, no patron who cared whether they lived or died.</p>

                <p>Sun was fine with that. No god had answered his prayers when the elven nobility slew his father in their political games. No god had wiped the sweat from his brow as he took his father’s place at the smithy. No god helped him hide the books he’d stolen in the dead of night, nor help him pit the elven nobility against each other using hit-and-run tactics. It was his fellow man that helped him hide. Helped him learn. It was his fellow man that helped him drive a blade through the heart of his father’s killer. But guile and trickery would not get him much farther. It was when he was unknown, hidden, that he managed to claim ownership of a small strip of fertile land nestled between an empire and two kingdoms. It took a lot of politicking, spying, and scheming to get the three countries to agree to a treaty for twenty years. The elves knew about him now, from the royals across the continent to the exiles living in their small villages.</p>

                <p>“The Fierce Mockingbird” they’d called him, joking about how a human managed to trick not one, but three elven rulers. But Sun could see the scorn in the eyes of the powerful. They could wait twenty years; it was barely anything for an elf. It could mean everything for humanity. There have been human towns before, perhaps even cities. But this was the first human country. And it was surrounded by those who would seek to undo everything.</p>

                <p>Sun Auric had had his revenge. It wouldn’t be worth it if he couldn’t protect what he’d built. So for the first time, Sun would pray. He would pray with all his heart and body, by kneeling before one of the last few Primordials to survive to this age. He would pray to the one who had nobody pray to it, just as humans had nobody to pray to.</p>

                <p>Skorm, the Destroyer.</p>

                <p>Skorm lived atop a mountain of jagged obsidian, in the middle of a desolate wasteland of Skorm’s own creation. There was not a trace of Sol’s light to be seen, but it was not dark. The clouds above would rupture and split, releasing arcs of lightning and beams of devastating light. Glacial winds blew constantly in every direction, sending obsidian shards through any who dared approach. Even breathing in the air would lacerate one’s lungs with obsidian dust. The mountain itself was brittle; anywhere one would try to grab cut would into one’s flesh, hungrily drinking up blood. The mountain would shake and shudder, sending avalanches of glistening black knives cascading in every direction. There was no water nor food on the on the way up. No sane being would take this climb to stand face to face with Skorm. It had taken powerful troupes of warriors months cross the plains and reach the summit.</p>

                <p>Sun Auric did it in a week.</p>

                <p>It was hot at the top, unbearably so. Lava seeped between cracks and flowed in absurd manners. It seeped upwards in a variety of directions, forming glowing red trees with obsidian at its extremities shattering and being blown away by tempestuous winds. At the center of the peak, from where all the liquid rock flowed, was a hole darker than any night Sun had seen. And from within, was the sound of subtle scuttering, like leaves dancing on wood. But every now and then, Sun would hear a rock dislodge and hit something again and again, until it would fall too far down for even echoes to reach him. The wind quieted, lamenting softly between liquid branches of stone. Then, the wind slowed and stood still, leaving nothing but the sound of the man’s breathing on the peak. Until the mountain started to quiver. Rocks shook apart, hitting against one another down the hole, sounding like demented chimes rattling in fear. The trees of lava ballooned and imploded, sending globules of lava in a deadly spray as gravity asserted itself once more upon them. And from the hole erupted a pillar of glistening darkness. It uncoiled upwards and fissured the sky into loops until its head came to rest an arm’s length away from Sun Auric.</p>

                <p>Two sets of mandibles surrounded Sun, as the front of the Primordial split open to reveal countless filaments sparking with red lightning. Sun could see a shudder run across the being’s body, up into the sky and around several times before disappearing back into the hole. The colossal centipede-like creature swerved its head as a few of its endless pairs of legs twitched curiously. The air permeated with the smell of ozone and burnt roaches.</p>

                <p><b>“Who…are…you?”</b> The voice resounded heavily, yet without a sound, existing only within their minds.</p>

                <p>“Neither food nor foe, Skorm.” Sun Auric wasn’t afraid of death.</p>

                <p><b>“Rare…are those…who do not grovel.”</b> The tendrils approached Auric, swaying mere centimeters from Auric’s chestplate. <b>“Shall I…kill you…for your…impertinence?”</b></p>

                <p>“If you wish. But I will only bow if we come to an agreement.”</p>

                <p><b>“An arrogant…little…elvenoid…wants to make…a deal?”</b> The sparking filaments hovered over the armor, dancing precariously.
                    <b>“Rare…are those like…you. The…arrogant…fools.”</b> The tendrils touched Sun and sparked intensely for a moment. But he stood still. Unharmed.</p>

                <p>“I am no ‘elvenoid’, nor am I rare. I am human. I am common, yet unique.”</p>

                <p>Skorm tilted its head. <b>“Fascinating. That usually…sublimates.”</b></p>

                <p>“A product of my research. It’s a new metal.” Auric waved his gauntleted hand through the myriad tendrils. “The fact that I can even be tickled from your magic speaks magnitudes of your power. I had thought it perfect.”</p>

                <p><b>“Arrogant…but capable of it.”</b> A whip crack echoes across the desolate wasteland as the Primordial squirms happily.
                    <b>“I…do not…dislike that. What do you…seek?”</b></p>

                <p>“I need a patron. I want to become your first acolyte.”</p>

                <p><b>“That can be…arranged.”</b></p>

                <p>“And your last.”</p>

                <p>The two stared at each other. Lightning began to run across Skorm’s vast carapace, arcing and connecting in frantic loops.</p>

                <p><b>“Do you even know. What you ask?”</b></p>

                <p>“I will have no other god but you…” The first human king got on one knee.</p>

                <p><b>“I have MADE gods!”</b> Red lightning struck a scant few meters away from Auric. The mountain trembled enough to collapse large swathes, entire acres of obsidian washed away in rage. The clouds above twisted and churned into a dark maelstrom.</p>

                <p>“And you will have no other mortal but I.” Auric continued, unflinching.</p>

                <p><b>“I have witnessed the rise of the first civilizations! I am one of Arbora’s greatest! You DARE assume to be my only acolyte?!”</b></p>

                <p>“I offer my people as worshippers, and a promise.” Auric bent the second knee and bowed. “I will show you destruction and change the likes of which you have never seen before.”</p>

                <p>The lightning stopped and the howling wind fell silent once more.</p>

                <p><b>“Here…is my offer.”</b> Skorm approached Auric, tendrils sparking as the immortal lifted him up to his feet, pulling his golden great-sword out of his sheath and putting it in his hands. <b>“Strike me. On this mandible.”</b> Skorm turned its head so that Auric could see the mandible, one twice as long as Auric was high, thick and unblemished.</p>

                <p><b>“If…what you can take from me…is not enough…I will go to your home…find your people…and show them true destruction. If. By some miracle. By Arbora’s grace. You manage to impress…me. I will accept you…as my first. My last. My only acolyte. And you will have…my favor.”</b></p>

                <p>Auric readied his blade.</p>

                <p><b>“Choose carefully…where you strike. It is easier to cut…nearer to the tip. It would be…embarrassing if you fail.”</b></p>

                <p>Auric gave a savage grin.</p>

                <p>And swung.</p>

                <p>I found my friend nestling his head in his arms in front of the computer, muttering a string of obscenities. A far cry from the man who’d proudly invited me to come see the simulacrum he made.</p>

                <p>“Years of work, wasted.” He grumbled with a sigh. “Programming a perfect physics engine, manipulating aspects to form a stable environment, procedurally generating generations of constructs that all interact with one another in a delicate balance, installing self-awareness onto several million different constructs, structuring colonies and inter-construct relationships…all falling apart because of a stupid mistake.”</p>

                <p>I sat on the desk, pushing away a few crumpled cans of energy drinks to make room. My friend had a few neuroses, but he was a kind man who often lost himself in his projects. Every now and then, he’d have an idea to make something, and he’d devote all of his energy into completing his objective. Once, he’d gotten into ship making, and ended up building a boat that he invited his friends to join him on. The days we spent on the ship were ones I’ll treasure for the rest of my life. It was rare to find him so disheartened.</p>

                <p>“Making a simulacrum is never easy.” I patted his back gently. “Experts devote decades of effort to even get a part of one working.”</p>

                <p>“I thought if I narrowed the process down to one instance, it’d be a lot easier.” He leaned back in his chair, waving to the screen. “Take a look.”</p>

                <p>I looked over the map that he made to represent the various facets of the simulacrum. The data was…worrying to say the least. Rife with half-measures slapped on top of one another to fix glaring issues in every aspect of the simulation. I couldn’t help but wince at the sight. We’d had the chance to see simulacrums made by some talented artists, millions of pieces working together to simulate a living, breathing world of light and wonder.</p>

                <p>My friend’s simulacrum was…not so good.</p>

                <p>There were some aspects that I couldn’t help but respect. He knew his limits, so the simulacrum operated on familiar aspects of our own reality. Why fix what was broken, right? Thermodynamics, gravity, nuclear forces, and a stunningly elegant, simplified rendition of our existing elemental system. The simulacrum was focused on a single planet orbiting a star. Much like our own world, the simulacrum’s surface was mostly water with six continents and magnetic poles.</p>

                <p>“I know the true artists would say it’s unoriginal, but I had to start somewhere.”</p>

                <p>“Fair, fair.” I nodded but frowned and pointed at something that jumped out at me. “What is that?”</p>

                <p>“Right, yeah. Some of the constructs only have one hole. That’s how they all started.” He stretched back and buried his face again. “That’s where the problems started.”</p>

                <p>The logs seemed to agree with him. The constructs that descended from the first all started out with one hole. Some would even close one end of the hole to make a cavity. That was only the beginning. Some constructs eventually developed proper circulatory and nervous systems, but they were unreliable and jenky. The materials the constructs were made from were far more fallible than our own. They could fail for several reasons, ending the instance of the construct permanently. Yet their fragility and chaotic divergences over myriad generations of development led to some interesting constructs. Most lacked the typical skeletal and muscular systems we were used to. Some of them had too few limbs, or far too many.</p>

                <p>“Freaky.” I skimmed through the thousands of lines of data, a hodgepodge documentation of the speciation my friend had made in a hurry. “Does this one have thorns on its tentacles? And this one sweats slime?”</p>

                <p>“Don’t mind those, I leave most of them alone. They’re fairly self-regulating.” He hurriedly passed over the next few pages.</p>

                <p>“‘Fairly?’”</p>

                <p>“Stuff in the oceans can get freaky.”</p>

                <p>I noted that he failed to mention that his oceans were made of a terribly corrosive compound, but I chalked it up to one of his neuroses. Seemed like he wanted his oceans to be impassible. The constructs apparently had different plans. I wanted to question him about it, but I noticed something that should cheer him up.</p>

                <p>“Hey, over forty distinct species capable of higher reasoning. That’s pretty good. Are any of them self-aware?”</p>

                <p>Simulacra typically had hundreds of construct species capable of reasoning. It couldn’t typically be called a simulacrum until there were at least a dozen such species. The real gems were the ones that had a few self-aware species stewarding the simulacrum’s balance for countless cycles.</p>

                <p>“Couple dozen.”</p>

                <p>“That’s great!” I beamed. My friend did not.</p>

                <p>“Individuals. Several cycles ago.” My smile fell. I’d never heard of a construct species that could not become wholly self-aware. My friend continued gruffly. “The majority of the construct species that’s giving me the most trouble.”</p>

                <p>He pulled up the data on the species. I winced. Their stats were…unenviable. The organic systems of the constructs got in each other’s way constantly, with no space for redundant systems. The skeletal structure was inherently flawed, likely to accommodate the grabbers that they relied on.</p>

                <p>“Why aren’t there any other constructs as capable?”</p>

                <p>“A few of them had potential to develop their nervous systems enough to become rivals to this dominant species. But they lacked grabbers themselves, did not have long enough lifespans, or had the propensity to eat their mates or their young.” He tapped the screen a few times gruffly. “Or these fellows hunted them to extinction. Even if they were basically the same model construct. Little shits.”</p>

                <p>“Okay, what about those who became self-aware?”</p>

                <p>“Oh, they got killed by their peers. Most of them anyways. The smarter ones kept their mouths shut. Except one.” He pointed to the map of the world, towards one of the more arid subcontinents. “One was a scholar and managed to spread his message from here, but there have been so many misinterpretations of his words that his truth has been lost over the cycles.”</p>

                <p>“Ouch. They were close, then?”</p>

                <p>“So close.” My friend gritted his teeth. “I thought as much, too. I did something dumb.”</p>

                <p>I sat up and looked closer at the screen. I pointed at a spot in the log.</p>

                <p>“What happened here?”</p>

                <p>“Started interfering.”</p>

                <p>I frowned as I looked over the data. Massive matter restructuring, thermodynamics manipulation, biological twisting, all impossible for a typical construct. These events were scattered across the globe. This was not a light touch.</p>

                <p>“Wow, that’s bad. You must have ended thousands of instances.”</p>

                <p>“And many more unintentionally.”</p>

                <p>“Well, that’s not too bad. Even Vee had to do some tweaking.”</p>

                <p>“Sent down an avatar.”</p>

                <p>I sucked in a breath. Sending an avatar into a simulacrum was reserved for when the simulacrum was ready, when the construct species were ready for the whole truth behind their existence.</p>

                <p>“As yourself?”</p>

                <p>“I’m not that dumb. I was very careful.”</p>

                <p>Looking over the logs in the simulacrum, I couldn’t help but nod in approval as to the location he chose. A key location in the center of a trade route within a stable empire on the larger of the two supercontinents. The perfect place to plant an idea to spread to the rest of the world.</p>

                <p>“I made an avatar that looked like one of them. Maybe I went in a bit hotheaded. I ended up whipping some constructs.” I blinked and craned my head slowly to look at him.</p>

                <p>“Really, dude?” To his credit, he looked embarrassed.</p>

                <p>“Listen, somewhere along the line, they got obsessed with numbers. Give them a number to assign worth to, and they go absolutely nuts over making the number bigger, even to the detriment of themselves, their peers, and the simulacrum itself.”</p>

                <p>“Their stupidity was not an excuse.”</p>

                <p>“I know, I know!” My friend’s growl tapered into a sad sigh. “This world I made…it flawed. To its very core. Every time I try to fix it, I end up making it worse.”</p>

                <p>I could understand his feelings. He’d tried to make his own little reality, but its flaws stacked atop each other like a tower that threatened to crumble at any moment. He’d made a world of death and poison, of rot and greed, populated by the only ones that could survive the mistakes he made. They were a species that thrived on division, that relished in competition, and destroyed without care. Just so they could survive one more day.</p>

                <p>“They got rid of me a while later. They can be very…creative with their punishments.”</p>

                <p>For a simulacrum to reject its creator was…inconceivable.</p>

                <p>“I was disturbed. I forgot to pause the cycles while I went to get my bearing again. By the time I came back, over a thousand cycles had passed, and they’d figured out how to mass-produce death. The words I gave, the cloak of comfort and truth were unwoven, then spread and twisted into the threads of persecution and hate, woven into yet another mantle of power. Those who had never heard of my avatar were closest to self-awareness. But they too were brought low and churned into a system that will prevent the constructs from ever reaching beyond. By those who claimed to be my followers, no less.”</p>

                <p>I didn’t know what to say. I wondered if it was possible for my friend to hate the simulacrum he’d made. I didn’t think it was possible, but this was a series of firsts for me. The only thing I could offer was my condolences.</p>

                <p>“Worse yet, they’ve started making their own constructs. Basic ones, but constructs, nonetheless. I shudder to think what would happen should they succeed.”</p>

                <p>If these constructs rejected their creator, would the ones they made do the same? Would they compete with their creators until they overtake them and hunt the original constructs until none remained? Or would they be improved versions of themselves, the true inheritors of my friend’s simulacrum?</p>

                <p>“Come, friend.” I reached out. “Maybe it’s best to let things play out.”</p>

                <p>“Fine.” He left his chair in a huff. “Do you think our own simulacrum’s creators had ever made something like them?”</p>

                <p>“Probably.” I shrugged. “Or maybe you made something unique enough to impress them.”</p>

                <p>“I am not going to show off humanity.” My friend scoffed. “They are still too flawed. Maybe they will always be.”</p>

                <p>The world as we know it did not begin as a bang or a pop, or even as a flood, but with the resonant groans and screech of space tearing itself apart, only for the Being to come through the fissure in all that once was into our realm, golden ichor flowing down its pristine body before ebbing away into a trickle, then a muted desert upon its titanic body; wounds sustained from unknowable creatures in the Beyond that soon followed the Being here, abrasive shapes without color or substance, teeth upon teeth upon teeth, gnawing and gnashing at the primordial entity, its many eyes swiveling about as it held them all back, their contorting tendons and misshapen orifices squelching about in diseased screeches capable of rendering any mortal being insane and abstract, in both body and mind, but not the Being, not its majestic self that tore off its own horns to stab at the darkness, stabbing and tearing that which could not be stabbed or torn, its biggest eye unblinking and fearless as it shone upon the shadows of Thereafter and Before, the creatures and monsters that Should-Not-Be, brilliance unrelenting for millennia upon millennia, before time even knew itself, its six arms where brought together in one final clasp, a prayer to itself as it sent the scant remains of its foes into the recesses of the infinite Void, falling asleep once and for all, bones, skin, muscle collapsing together in a massive mesh of bone shards, twisted flesh, and stretched sinew, all upon itself to become the very earth we walk upon; but even still, the Being dreams and watches over itself, eyes wandering the cosmos watching all of Infinity, as the maggots and fleas festering beneath its skin struggled out into the brilliance of its biggest eye, the one that outshone all others, and thought the first primitive thoughts, crawling into fetid beings seeking and failing to recreate themselves over the course of centuries in the Being’s perfect image; their pale and weak skin could not harden like the Being’s mountainous own, nor could they see through more than two eyes, they failed at ever growing more than two arms, and eternally divided themselves, forever cursed into a cruel facsimile of the true power and beauty.</p>



                <p>Thus Humanity was born.</p>

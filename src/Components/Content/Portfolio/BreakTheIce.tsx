                <p>Polly was in trouble. She’s just been pulled from a failing section of New Haven. She watches through the dark windows as a section of a massive submarine city sinks into the darkness below. Silver bubbles trickle from the aft section, floating bodies suspended in the soft green light of New Haven. Things dart in the water, pulling away bodies beyond their sight. Polly shivers, feeling deaths embrace tickle her back. She looks down into her hand clenching the data chip tightly into her palm. She is but one of the many people in a catatonic state by the sealed corridor. Slowly the woman gets up to her shaky legs. She can’t give up now. Clenching her jaw and taking a few deep breaths, Polly begins to walk. The walk turns into a jog, then a run. She rushes past claustrophobic sections of the ship focusing on the task at hand.</p>

                <p>The red lights of the sirens flash upon every surface, people rushing about, trying desperately to find friends family or get to the necessary stations. Engineers crawl from portholes pouring themselves out of flooded sections, frenzied eyes darting about, looking for flaws, cracks, and leaks. The guards’ disciplined demeanors are absent, disheveled uniforms barely covering the bruises they tried to hide. Nevertheless, when they see Polly in the officer’s uniform, they salute and let her pass. The same could not be said for the panicking civilians whom they beat back violently and sometimes fatally. Have they been less tired, more aware, they might have noticed her officer’s uniform as too tight in some places and looser in others.</p>

                <p>Polly cut through hydroponic section, terrified gardeners, scientists, and workers shoveling seeds and plants into special containers. Two senior scientists were arguing which plants to save, but a flash of silver outside of the window and the sound of that insufferable clicking cowed them enough to decide. The madness stretching throughout New Haven, the fear that infected every one of them, it was the very thing Polly’s teachers had warned her about in her youth. A cascading panic that had condemned many of the earliest colonists to a watery grave.</p>

                <p>She stumbled over something, looking down to find a body. She didn’t know who he was, but his slit throat and surprised expression told her enough. Polly shook herself from her stupor, pushing away an assistant who was just trying to find something to do.</p>

                <p>“Give me orders! Anything, anything!” He begged from behind her.</p>

                <p>Using the security card she’d pulled from the last owner of the uniform, Polly entered the water treatment facility. It had already been abandoned, leaks springing out from the labyrinthian mess of pipes that fed into every part of New Haven. It wasn’t the only water treatment facility, but the way New Haven had grown to enmesh itself with redundant sections and failsafe upon failsafe had made this water treatment section too closely bound to the rest of New Haven. Should it take on too much water, more pieces of New Haven would rip off, sinking into the depths of the frozen planet.</p>

                <p>Even now, brave workers in deep-sea suits lit acetylene torches to plug the leaks in water treatment facility 1B. The smell of ozone pervaded throughout the room, bright flashes sparkling through the leaks. Polly walked with measured confidence, thumb tracing the chip on her palm. To think all this happened because a powerful director over three hundred years ago wanted to control all communication between New Haven and the other submarine cities. Polly groaned in pain. The drugs were wearing off. She pressed a hand to her side, filling the warm blood ooze through the uniform. She passed her medical wand over her side, reading the updated prognosis. Still no sign of internal injuries, but if she did not stimy the blood fast, she would not be able to save New Haven, and perhaps all colonies trapped on this barren world. She pulled the syringe out of her pack, tapped it a few times, and jammed it by the stab wound. The coagulant should help for now. Polly considered pulling out some more painkiller, but she did not want to risk dulling her faculties.</p>

                <p>New Haven shuddered again, whether it was from another piece of itself falling into the abyss, one of its massive weapons firing, or from the strange beings that attacked her home, Polly did not know. She’s stabilized herself holding on to the side of the door as she passed the ID over the reader. With a buzz, the doors opened and for the first time, Polly was in with the oldest parts of New Haven. She’d heard how the greatest of New Haven lived there, only those who showed the most distinction in service to the Director would be allowed the honor to live in the original section of the submarine city. Oldtown was spoken of in reverence throughout the submarine city.</p>

                <p>It was here that intercoms were replaced by touch screens and holograms, vending machines replaced with purified water stations and cafeterias. Wide passageways, lined with plants with no other purpose than to bring greenery to the locale. Underneath it all there was a hint of ancient grace, the carefully polished surfaces having long been replaced and refurbished several times. Despite the shine and the best tech, the people here ran about with the same confusion as their peers in the ‘redundant’ sections. It was true their uniforms were cleaner, more well-kept, and the equipment they wore with several generations more advanced than anything Polly had seen before. But in the end, they share the same ship, the same tenuous grasp on survival.</p>

                <p>Polly once considered the old towners as distinguished elites. The little she’d seen of them outside of New Haven’s core quickly disabused her of that notion. Although they were arrogant and spiteful, it brought her no joy to see them like this, no matter how much pain they had inflicted on their perceived lessers. Mothers pulled crying infants away from fathers sent to do the most dangerous repairs, the desperate situation pulling every ounce of manpower from the community. Polly took care not to limp as she made her way down the cavernous hallways, eyes focused directly forward so she would not seem more out of place. Even when she passed by a vent and swore she could see movement within, she did not react. She climbed through the promenade stairs, careful to keep this side and let rushing civilians and workers get to where they needed to go. The painkillers had begun to fade from her systems, a bright lance of agony digging into her side. Once again, she cursed whoever had come up with a weapon as cruel as the vibroknife.</p>

                <p>All at once, the holograms and the screens lit up, a cheerful ‘ding-dong’ emanating from the speakers. Director Woodshaw’s face appeared, her stern features and pursed lips causing everyone to stop in place.</p>

                <p>“We are currently dealing with an outside attack. they have dealt negligible damage to redundant systems. Unfortunately, this chaos has given rise to some criminal elements who wished to destroy our way of life.”</p>

                <p>Polly winced. she did not like where this was going. Woodshaw’s face disappeared, replace by an image of Polly herself, cut from recent camera footage. She was wide eyed and terrified, her red hair peaking beneath the worker’s cap she kept atop her head to prevent it from being caught in any machinery. It was taken more than a week ago, when she was first dragged into this whole mess. Woodshaw’s voice spoke over the image.</p>

                <p>“This is Polly Grimsley. Terrorist, disturber of peace, and murderer of one officer James Lemoyne, the renowned hero. This disgraced doctor intends to destroy all that we hold dear. She is highly dangerous and collaborating with the enemy. Lemoyne’s access codes and passcards have just been deactivated. His ID was last used 2 minutes ago in section B, level 8. Be advised, Polly Grimsley is now in Old Town.”</p>

                <p>Polly’s heart jumped, fear turning her veins cold as the frozen ocean outside. Already, decorated guards were turning in her direction. Just as one pointed in her direction, eyes wide open in recognition, a blossom of red erupted on his chest. People screamed as the man collapsed to the ground, dead. The guards looked wildly in every direction, crimson gouts exploding across their bodies. Polly could see shadows wielding airguns from the vents. A muzzle would peek out from a hole: a vent beneath a cushioned bench, above a light, on a corner, little places from where the undesirables crawled, parts that the old towners had forgotten about long ago. A barrel will reach out, whisper a puff, and slide back away to disappear into the dark, leaving naught but terror and dead bodies in its wake.</p>

                <p>Panic the old towners did, the careful veneer of civility dissipating as the largest authorities begin to fall like flies. Most people ran in different directions, seeking shelter wherever they could, hoping to find some protection from the unseen enemy. A hand reached out from the vents by Polly’s feet. It gave her a thumbs up. Polly shuddered but kept walking towards the central command room. Another rumble echoed throughout New Haven. She was running out of time. Higher and higher she climbed, any guard who made their way towards her collapsing in a tangle of limbs. People began to look at her in terrified awe, wrenching her heart from her chest. She didn’t have time to make them understand. She didn’t have time to heal the injured or help the lost, as she was trained to do. She flinched away from the spiteful glares a brave few sent in her direction. Until finally, she stood before the heavy copper doors, decorated with the emblem of a company long evolved into governance. Apparently, the animal displayed was a whale, a creature native to earth’s cold oceans. It had been taken on as a mascot, a testament to humanity’s desire to survive, no matter where it was.</p>

                <p>The same hand reached from another vent, waving her closer. There was a spark and the door opened, revealing a panicked Woodshaw. The director was busy tossing papers into the fireplace, a luxury Polly had once disregarded as some inane rumor. And yet here she was, watching the Director destroy information to protect herself, her forebears, and whatever ounce of dignity the Board of Directors clung to.</p>

                <p>The scared expression disappeared from her face, falling into a comfortable tone like that of a disappointed mother.</p>

                <p>“What you intend to do is madness.” Woodshaw stood tall her hands firmly on her desk. “Disabling weapons? Initiating communications? You’re begging for us to destroyed!”</p>

                <p>“I was trying to tell you earlier this is the best solution.” Polly stood taller, meeting the director’s eyes.</p>

                <p>“You intend for us to be enslaved! Become… serfs to these beings!” the director spat baleful glare flitting between Polly and the glassteel window to the outside.</p>

                <p>Someone who was part of the insurgency would have spat in her face. They would have held the mirror to director Woodshaw and decried that she, and all the other directors had already condemned everyone else to an eternity of slavery to support their extravagant lifestyles. They would have pointed out the political games played between the city ships, the millions of lives lost over the centuries, just so certain factions could have power over others.</p>

                <p>Polly simply sighed.</p>

                <p>“First you said they were the new weapons of Benthos. when we found Benthos destroyed, their automatic weapon systems still online, you claimed it was the work of new life forms attacking humanity. When we said there was no evidence of such organisms, you made all who corroborated that statement disappear. You tried to make me disappear. You made it so any methods of attempted communication were shot down, sometimes literally. And you ask why they have the indecency to fight back. Now, your bags are packed, your private ship is ready, and you’re destroying evidence.” There was no anger in Polly’s voice. Just grim acceptance. “Stand aside. We need to talk to them.”</p>

                <p>Woodshaw slowly backed away, her motherly demeanor twisting into contorted scowl of rage. Her arm reached behind her as her back met the wall.</p>

                <p>“Do you know how much I’ve sacrificed?” The Director hissed, clenching her fist.</p>

                <p>Polly rolled her eyes, holding the chip carefully before the central command console. Woodshaw leaped forward, vibroknife heading directly towards Polly’s neck. There was whisper, a puff, and a scream. The blade clattered to the floor, the former director holding her bloodied hand as she writhed on the ground. Polly, exhausted by the pain, gave a small thumbs up to the man just outside the door. He nodded but kept his air gun aimed directly at the director. Polly put the chip in the console and the thrum of the weapons ceased.</p>

                <p>“You’ve killed us all.” Woodshaw’s growl faded into a whimper and she backed away from the window.</p>

                <p>The console blinked, and Polly began to broadcast on all spectrums and frequencies. her head was on every screen, her voice in every intercom.</p>

                <p>“My name is Polly Grimsley. I never wanted to be here. Once I dreamed of being capable enough to be recognized and join the people of Oldtown. Recently, I’ve been enlightened on our situation, on the difficulties that generations of Directors refused to acknowledge. Maybe because it was too difficult. Maybe because they got used to a lifestyle that ran on the blood, sweat, and tears of the innocent.” Another jolt of pain caused her body to spasm. James’s last gift to her. “I am attempting to communicate with the attacking forces. This will be on all frequencies so I hope they can hear me. we’ve disarmed our weapons, we mean no harm. We’d like to ask many questions, but one of which remains at the forefront of my mind.”</p>

                <p>Polly swallowed, gripping onto the side of the console tightly. It felt like she was about to fall unconscious. Her head was light, and stars danced in her vision.</p>

                <p>“Why are you here?”</p>

                <p>The sound of explosions had faded away. All around the submarine city, people nursed their wounds, fixed damaged equipment, and prayed with an eye on the intercoms. Those closest to the walls separating the world outside from their refuge could feel the clicking echo through the water. The transmission didn’t stop in New Haven. Polly’s message was broadcasted to every submarine, every colony, every radio. The scattered remains of humanity stood still for one moment, waiting with bated breath.</p>

                <p>The clicking outside stopped. A gray figure floated into view in front of the glassteel window. It moved like an organism would, with all the fluid movements and mannerisms that machines could not replicate. It was at least five meters long, with a thick tail and flippers to maintain its position in the water. Yet it was made of steel, a hard carapace speckled with small lights and equipment nobody in the world had seen before. Polly slowly pressed a few buttons on the console so what she saw would be screened on every device in New Haven. The strange bio-mechanical being looked at Polly through the window, though she knew from experience the glass was one way.</p>

                <p>Seams appeared on the carapace, splitting open to reveal a black and white creature. It swam out of its suit, Polly’s mouth opening in awe. Its intelligent black eyes shone from underneath a pair of white spots, marred only by a bit of blinking metal melded into its skin. It swam in circles, twirling about, its mouth opening in glee to reveal a set of conical teeth. Polly had only read of them in textbooks. It was an orca, a type of whale. Native to Earth.</p>

                <p>The orca settled back into its suit, the frame closing tightly around it again. A series of clicks resonated from it, and a message began to play over the speakers.</p>

                <p>“We are here to help join the others.” It was undoubtedly the whale who spoke. “We welcome you into the United Terran Governments.”</p>

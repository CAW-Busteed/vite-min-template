                <p>There is a certain mindset especially prevalent among those who sing the praises of cryptocurrency and NFT’s despite their many flaws. It is the pervasive need for everything to have value. I don’t mean that they value the time they have with family or adopt a mindset of gratefulness for the small joys in life. It is more literal: value only exists in things that have monetary worth. You could see it in the most popular NFT’s: they’re ugly, but they’re mass produced, ‘unique’, and have plenty of hype. Digital Funko pops, except made exclusively to be resold. They are valuable because they are unique, and a single person can ‘own’ the source. Even though the nature of the internet means that you can’t really ‘own’ a meme, as it goes against everything that makes a meme. But I’m not here to talk about the flaws of cryptocurrency and NFT’s, there have been many great discussions about them already. I want to talk about the people behind them, the supporters.</p>

                <p>This need for making anything and everything a vehicle to turn a profit is indicative of a large population tying monetary worth to self-worth. This is widespread in people that grew up in the shrinking middle class, who are desperate to live the comfortable lifestyle of their parents in an economy that won’t exactly let them. No wonder the suicide rate has increased in the last two decades. And how could you blame them? We are born and raised in a society dictated by numbers, with an entire generation of people traumatized by the 2008 crash. You need good GPA to enter a good middle school, then high school, then college. You don’t want to be poor, right? Your worth is connected to the number in your bank account. A country is only worth its GDP, rather than how happy the people are, and a company’s success is measured by yearly profit growth in a finite system. We see that the wheels of our economy have been greased with our blood while the uber-wealthy sit comfortably in their ivory towers.</p>

                <p>It’s easy to become disillusioned with the current economic situation, and to feel rudderless once you leave the confines of a regimented school system and into a chaotic maelstrom of choices.</p>

                <p>It’s easy to look up to them, the successful people, the seemingly self-made, the rich, the powerful, and take their advice at face value. After all, they have money, therefore they have worth and wisdom.</p>

                <p>It’s easy to fall for promises of wealth, of salvation, an alternative to a system that has screwed us over before. It’s the allure of a community that promises all that and more.</p>

                <p>“You wanna be successful? You gotta grind. Invest in cryptocurrencies, and hold fast, hold hard. Keep at it and you’ll have diamond hands, and we’ll go to the moon.” You start using terms to differentiate the in-group from the out-group, the faithful from the naysayers. A cult that worships money rather than a nebulous higher being. Maybe it’s too harsh to compare the cryptobros community to a cult. But when you buy into the mentality, and are willing to sacrifice relationships, morals, and other intangible yet valuable things for a community revolving around money…it does sound a bit like a cult.</p>

                <p>It’s an interesting community mindset. They’re willing to do anything to get ‘the number’ to go up, casually committing pump-and-dump schemes as if it’s a normal thing to do. They’re a community of gamblers led by those wealthy enough to mint and produce their cryptocurrencies in bulk. You think your cryptocurrency is going to make you rich? Maybe if you had a couple hundred grand to spare on massive crypto mining rigs, you’d start at the same level as the successful ones. When it comes down to it, you’re buying what someone else is selling with the hope you can sell it at a higher price. That’s not an alternative to late-stage capitalism, nor the gig economy, and it’s no great equalizer. Cryptocurrency isn’t an alternative to our current capitalistic society…it’s DLC.</p>

                <p>What people fail to realize that for most of society, failure can be anything between a setback and bankruptcy…Whereas for the wealthy, there are so many safety nets in place, people can fail upwards in society. With so many safety nets, you can afford to take risk after risk and bear the consequences. You can invest in so many opportunities and walk off barely any worse for wear financially. As an example, the lottery. A rich person could buy a higher chance at winning the lottery by buying hundreds of tickets. Even if they lose, that money is worth so little to them it doesn’t matter. It’d be like losing a penny. If a poorer person tried that, they have the same chances at winning, but that money could have been dedicated to medical expenses, food, gas…The depth of the risk is much greater. Cryptocurrency is the same.</p>

                <p>Now I could go into how NFT’s are a weird sort of self-selling ad, an ouroboros of selling something whose only perceived value is how much you can sell it for. Or how NFT’s exist only so more people invest in cryptocurrency so the people at the top can sell their money for more than they spent on it. The point is, this mess is the result of a decaying or stagnant system. Capitalism, as our main method of resource allocation, needs to evolve with the times. It isn’t bad; just like any system, it decays over time and requires upkeep. You can’t exactly expect a road to fix itself if you get more cars on the road, nor can you force a human body to work better by giving it more food. Why do we expect our economy to be maintained by doing the bare minimum? It needs to adapt. Maybe connect value to resources that are used over time, like energy or water. You can’t exactly store too much of either of those without losing returns in the long run. This ‘use it or lose it’ model may work, or maybe there can be other options. Who knows, maybe we will eventually see capitalism as a relic of the past, as we currently see monarchies.</p>

                <p>To those cryptobros and NFT fans who will read this and claim I don’t understand anything, and I’m a suit, or blah blah blah…look up how cults work. Compare them to how people in your Discord servers, your subreddits, your Twitter network act. You are being scammed. You are being leeched from, culturally, economically, and emotionally. And if you still refuse to acknowledge this, or any of the myriad of others criticizing cryptocurrency, I’m sorry.</p>

                <p>Before there was matter, before there was thought, there existed two ancient forces, equal yet opposite. <b>Order</b> in all its cold, geometric perfection, pushing down on all in overwhelming light. <b>Chaos</b>, hot and tempestuous like an eternal ocean of darkness roiling up in an unrepentant tide. So it was for an eternity: two opposing forces, crashing and slamming against one another where they met in an eternal battle. It took but an instant, less than a heartbeat, for the impossible to happen and for things to change forever. In a moment beyond probability, <b>Chaos</b> and <b>Order</b> melded and organized into something new. That which was neither <b>Chaos</b> nor <b>Order</b>, more than mere energy, no bigger than a finger, a seed. The First Seed.</p>

                <p>The First Seed was tossed about in the scalding seas of <b>Chaos</b>, oppressed by the tyrannical glare of <b>Order</b>. Yet, it still lived. It sprouted and began to grow. Unmoving roots entrenched themselves deep into the oceans of <b>Chaos</b>. Branches rose despite the might of <b>Order</b> and reached high to sway in a non-existent breeze. So Arbora came to be. And the first thoughts followed. They were small thoughts at first, mere impressions. But as Arbora grew, so did her thoughts. Words to define concepts, and from these words was born a language, a truth. The first words became. More than mere sound, these words were painted upon the canvas of reality as interwoven sounds, sights, smells, and feelings, all working together to define that which could be.</p>

                <p>From this language, Arbora cultivated a world upon herself. From Arbora’s fiber, water dripped to flow into oceans, stone grew and formed mountains, subtle breaths developed into hurricanes, sparks of fire burning up into infernos. Landscapes shifted and changed, but it lacked…something.</p>

                <p>Arbora made life in her image upon her ‘bark’. Mangroves, her first children, made land from sea. Mighty oaks broke down mountains into plains. Titanic redwoods tore storms into gentle breezes. Xeli ferns sapped heat from the deserts to create tundra. Arbora made more; beasts to roam the land and carry seeds on fur and fuzz, in stomach and beak. From these beings, a rare few became aware. But none would live long enough for the Allmother, for mortality was as necessary for life as conception.</p>

                <p>Arbora, tired of loneliness, took their memories, emotions, the shadow of their beings — all that was not material to mimic that which made Arbora more — and formed the first souls to absorb into herself. Every life from then on would have a seedsoul made from Arbora’s own soul. As every soul was loaned at birth, every soul was returned upon death. Over time, the experiences and memories would congregate within Arbora to form gestalt entities. Arbora had melded these massive souls with energy and concepts, forming beings of incredible power.</p>

                <p>From the instincts of every creature that has lived, Arbora formed two entities into the shapes of great fish, opposites that cannot live without each other. Sol would feed upon the energies of <b>Order</b> that bathed Arbora’s branches and release warm light to feed the denizens of Arbora’s bark. Lun would feed upon the <b>Chaos</b> mingling within Arbora’s branches and absorb the heat left by Sol to preserve balance. Others followed, born from sentiments shared by every living creature, defining and tying themselves to the concepts that made up the reality Arbora had built. Lonely Kidu. Reverent Nai. Productive Gilsh. Needy Jick. Protective Ord. Curious Fen. Destructive Skorm. As more came about over countless eons, cycles began to form. Just as Sol and Lun would define day and night, so too would others define winter and summer, blossom and decay, rain and drought.</p>

                <p>The first gods, the Primordials, lacked physical forms, leaving their unassailably massive souls exposed. Without bodies, they would not hunger, nor sleep, nor die. Neither could they experience the joys of mortality, like eating, like dreaming, like living. Immortality has a price; for Arbora, it is being the only one of her kind. For the Primordials, it was to remember everything good about being mortal, yet being unable to feel such things again. But immortality does not mean invincibility…</p>

                <p>Jick <i>wanted</i>. </p>

                <p>Jick wanted so much that it hurt not to have it, whatever it was. He wanted to feel wind fly in wings he never had, to taste the clear waters with a tongue he never had, had wanted to dream in a sleep he could never reach. Jick was desire, desire so simple yet so strong it would destroy him. He asked a gift from each of the Primordials in secret, so that he could build himself a body worthy of life.</p>

                <p>“May I have the best thing one can give to a living creature?”</p>

                <p>Kidu, the first Primordial, gave him great wings so that the creature could travel wherever it wished.</p>

                <p>Nai, ever-worshipping, gave him horns like branches so that the creature could be closer to Arbora.</p>

                <p>Gilsh, studious and clever, gave a mind rivalling that Arbora’s most ancient beings, so that the creature would be smart enough to tackle whatever problem came its way.</p>

                <p>Ord, always cautious, gave scales that would protect the creature against claw or fang.</p>

                <p>Fen, wondering what Jick intended, gave a pair of eyes that could see through anything…eyes Fen could use any time she desired.</p>

                <p>Skorm, all too eager, gave the sharpest fangs and claws, hesitating but a moment before offering his own tempestuous breath.</p>

                <p>Other Primoridals gave smaller gifts…a strong tail, a beautiful singing voice, limbs, a sturdy skeleton…And with them all, Jick shaped a mighty body worthy of him. Fen only realized what he was attempting too late, when she saw no soul enter Jick’s creation. She knew better, having tried something similar on a much smaller scale before. But it was too late. Jick poured all of himself into the body, but it would not live. For it to live, Jick had to be destroyed, and be reformed to fit the body he’d made. Perhaps Jick knew of this. Perhaps, he sought to create something that would destroy him and consume the pieces of his soul so that it would inherit his Desire. For unfulfilled desire to Jick was a torture worse than death, and if it took his annihilation to fulfill, it was a price he was willing to pay.</p>

                <p>Thus, the first god of flesh was created.</p>

                <p>Thus, the first dragon was created.</p>

                <p>Thus, Dohremi the Dragon-God came to be.</p>

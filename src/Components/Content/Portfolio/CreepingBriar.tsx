                <p>The briar bush curling around the sapling’s branches felt like barbed wire to Davit Tskhinvalieli. The way the thorns dug into his flesh, how they refused to break no matter how much he pulled at them…it was almost like the morning he’d woken up in Russia after falling asleep in Georgia. He caught his breath and calmly cut through the invasive briar to better allow the sapling to grow. He had to remind himself…he was no longer there. An ache in his heart as accompanied by a guilty sense of relief as he looked at his hands, calloused from hard work; not the hands of an academic’s as he’d hoped he would become, but hands so much like his parents’, and their parents before them.</p>

                <p>He furrowed his brow. There was nothing wrong with that. He’d been fortunate enough to take another language in college, and his degree in biology still counted for something, however minute it felt.</p>

                <p>“Hey Davit!” A woman called out to him.</p>

                <p>Farrah, a woman with darker skin than normally seen in his home country, was a jovial ranger with frizzy hair she kept in a bun when they were on duty. She worked with him and the other ‘night owls’ as national park rangers.</p>

                <p>“Hello Farrah.” Davit responded as he bundled together the branches of the bush he’d pulled out of the ground. “I have found another patch of Bull briar. There should be more nearby.”</p>

                <p>“That’s great!” Farrah nodded and swung her torch to look over the bundle he’d made. “But you’ve got a letter that just came in, you should take the opportunity to read it while you have supper.”</p>

                <p>Davit smiled and nodded, reigning in a sigh. As grateful as he was to have gotten a work visa in the United States, he couldn’t understand their culture’s views on food. He’d seen movies, of course, but assumed them exaggerated. There were no supras here, no celebrations like there’d been at home. Nobody had ever even heard of khachapuri, the cheesy bread that he’d regularly get from his baker neighbor in his family’s small Ossetian town. He couldn’t even make his own chacha, the grappa brandy having been classified as ‘moonshine’ without a proper permit.</p>

                <p>He scoffed as he walked back to the outpost. Ridiculous! Why would he need to comb through a bunch of documents he could barely understand to brew his own chacha? He’d been doing it since he was ten, when his own father showed him how to distill from their own wine. Every family had their own chacha recipe, how could he make his own without risking his work visa? He sighed as he made it back to the outpost, putting his hat on a perch and taking off his shoes before entering. An old habit he didn’t want to break, as he was always one to sit on a donkey. He found it funny how similar the American expression was: to be as stubborn as a mule.</p>

                <p>He went to his futon in the communal bedroom and leaned against the wall, picking up the envelope that was gently left on his bed. The address was written in a familiar handwriting, and when he opened it, he was welcomed by the familiar script of his homeland. His frown lessened as he began to read.</p>

                <p className="italics">Dear Davit,</p>

                <p className="italics">Your father and I understand how hard it must be for you. Know that we miss you just as much, we are thankful that you’d be willing to go so far for us. And being so close yet so far away to home must hurt you far more than us; your ears have dropped so low since Ana was buried and we were forced to leave her behind.</p>

                <p>Davit felt his broken heart tear a bit more. Not nearly as much as when he left his home, or even when his fiancé died, but nevertheless, the dull thrum of pain resonated throughout his body.</p>

                <p className="italcis">Some time away is important to you, and you must learn to move on. Ana was a special girl, and we’ve known her since you two were but children! But God has plans, plans we can’t fully understand. She was taken from us too soon, and sometimes I fear I may curse Him for taking her from us. We pray for her soul in our new cathedral, and though it may be beautiful, the large church feels empty without our own congregation. Tbilisi is a big, beautiful city, but much like the church, it feels empty without those important to us. You’ll be happy to know that Maia has gotten a successful job and is supporting your father and I enough that we soon will be able to call! This will be our last letter, and I hope to be able to hear my little wolf’s voice soon.</p>

                <p className="italics">Your worrying mother,</p>

                <p className="italics">Ketevan Abuladze</p>

                <p className="italics">P.S. The Americans landed and set up some men and tanks near the Russian border. We will stay strong with them.</p>

                <p>Davit neatly folded the letter and stashed it under his futon with all the other ones, as well as his passport and other forms of identification he fought tooth-and-nail for when he went back to Tbilisi with his family but without his old identification papers. He felt something crawling down his cheek but wiped it away. Thinking about Ana had often made him emotional. He could only give a small smile. After all, he and Ana had often watched old American films and joked that they’d go visit and see the land of excess for themselves. Who’d have thought he would make it and find himself wanting. He stretched and winced as he felt something dig into his forearm. He turned his arm over, and in the brighter light of the cabin, saw a thorn that had pierced through his shirt and into his skin.</p>

                <p>“Davit, get over here!” Farrah shouted from the dining room. “Food’s getting cold!”</p>

                <p>Davit quickly pulled the barb out of his skin and almost tossed it back on his bed. Smirking and shaking his head at what he’d almost done, he put it in his pocket. He made his way to the dining room, which, oddly enough, was completely dark.</p>

                <p>“Surprise!” A chorus of voice shouted as the lights came back on.</p>

                <p>Davit nearly jumped at that and raised his eyebrow when he saw his coworkers surrounding the dining room table.</p>

                <p>“Happy birthday, Davit!” Henry said as he patted his back. “Come on, sit at the head of the table.”</p>

                <p>Davit could feel his cheeks tighten as a small smile appeared for a moment.</p>

                <p>“I do not know if I should…we have a long day tomorrow.”</p>

                <p>“Pish-posh!” Henry waved his worries away before continuing when he saw Davit’s confused expression. “Never mind that, I mean. Today’s a special day and we can afford to celebrate; called in a favor and we’ll be on break tomorrow. Now sit, sit!”</p>

                <p>Henry went to the kitchen as the other park rangers began to talk with Davit. It was only when Davit smelled something familiar that he stopped talking. Henry had come back with plates stacked on his arms, holding food in such quantities that Davit was surprised nothing had fallen. The grizzled man smirked and began deftly placing plates onto the table.</p>

                <p>“Pretty impressive, huh?” Henry said as he finished putting all the plates down. “Used to work for my dad in a restaurant. I was always the best server.”</p>

                <p>Davit was too focused on the contents of the plates themselves. Grilled eggplant slices and bean soup, kebabs, and specially prepared chicken that smelt of garlic and walnuts…these were traditional Georgian dishes.</p>

                <p>“…How?” Davit gaped, breathing in the aroma of home.</p>

                <p>“Oh, that’s simple!” Farrah laughed. “When we learned your birthday was coming up — Through no help on your own, but I managed to work with that — We did some research! I used a bit of the internet, but Jakob sent a letter to the same address you correspond with to ask for advice!”</p>

                <p>Jakob waved from his seat while eyeing the stacks of food.</p>

                <p>“Your mom is such a peach!” Farrah continued. “She sent us some recipes, what happens during supra, and even recommended ways to get our own chacha!”</p>

                <p>Abagail laughed out loud as she held up several bottles of clear liquid.</p>

                <p>“My Da has his own distillery, so we managed to get some good ol’ Georgian brandy, made in the heart of the U.S. of A!” She explained with a southern drawl.</p>

                <p>“So, me and Henry were on distraction duty to get you out of the cabin while everyone else prepared.” Farrah began pointing out what the other rangers did. “Abagail got us the chacha, Jakob and Lenny went to pick up all the ingredients, and Rufus cooked it all!”</p>

                <p>“And I still am!” Rufus stuck his head out from the kitchen.</p>

                <p>Henry sat down at the other side of the table as glasses of chacha were poured but remained untouched. Davit’s eyes widened as Henry held his glass high and took the role of tamada, the toastmaster.</p>

                <p>“Tonight, we celebrate another year of Davit’s life. As tamada, elected since I have the strongest liver — ” There were chuckles around the table at this “ — I have the honor of declaring a toast to our dear friend. Davit has been an enthusiastic worker at the park and has always been willing a hand to coworker, visitor, and animal alike.” The table nodded, remembering the time Davit had coaxed a coyote out from beneath the cabin and sent it on its way. “Davit, you’re a treasure to all of us and we all wish you a happy birthday.”</p>

                <p>Glasses were raised with a cheer, and everyone drank. Throughout the night, plates of food were piled upon plates; sauces, breads, meats and all manner of things in between were had. The festivities continued past dawn, toasts to family, friends, Georgia, America, chacha, and everyone else were proclaimed, and the party continued until the sun was high in the sky.</p>

                <p>Davit woke the morning after that with a terrible hangover and a bright smile, feeling that home was not as far as he’d thought.</p>

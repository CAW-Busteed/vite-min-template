                <p>Chanam could feel Luna’s gaze on him as he loaded the rifle. The girl was curious, which was a given considering she’d fallen out of time. And as her closest living descendent, Chanam had a responsibility to her. As he carefully calibrated the scope, he watched her through one of the OAD’s many cameras. The lens focused on her expression; lips pursed as she ran her fingers across her silver bracelet, blue eyes darting between the gun and the back of Chanam’s head. She almost reached for a ponytail that was no longer there, before her hand dropped down to rest on her knee.</p>

                <p>“I can’t believe we still use them.”</p>

                <p><i>[Luna is likely referring to the gun, 64% prob — ]</i></p>

                <p>Chanam turned off his neural interface’s social interaction amelioration app with a thought. As someone born a millennia ago, Luna wasn’t relying on one to convey the intricacies of conversation, so using it would only be detrimental. Chanam made a note to put her on the application’s exclusion list.</p>

                <p>“Guns? Or weapons in general?”</p>

                <p>It was tricky for Chanam to pronounce the ‘g’s in Classical English, but he was a quick learner, even at 57. When he first told Luna his age, she told him he didn’t look a day over thirty. He responded that was because of stress.</p>

                <p>“I think both?” Luna leaned closer to eye the rifle. “I mean, I’d hope after a thousand years we’d have moved beyond weapons — ”</p>

                <p>“Trust me when I say: you missed the worst of it.” Chanam could see his own shoulders tense at the deluge of memories. Luna took a sharp breath at the faux pas.</p>

                <p>“So I hear.” Luna nodded, leaning back. “But I thought the weapons of the future would be more…futuristic?”</p>

                <p>The Ranger turned around to look at her with his biological eyes and raised a brow.</p>

                <p>“Okay, so, gene therapy, evolving implants, all that is super advanced for me. I mean, in my time, we had ideas about it, but no real way to implement it. But guns? With actual bullet casings and everything?” She pointed at the rifle and swiveled her hand around. “It all seems so…mundane. Shouldn’t you be shooting plasma, or lasers, or I dunno, swarms of nanobots?”</p>

                <p>Chanam sighed and concentrated on the scope once more, looking down the cliff and into the valley. According to his HUD, there’d been a river there once. In fact, there were signs of virtual sprays and graffiti where the river used to run, where children and teens would decorate the walls in augmented reality. Heat signatures showed eight sets of footprints disappearing into an alcove. The people Chanam was hunting. He took the magazine out and pulled out two of the bullets, leaving seven high impact rounds and one special round inside the magazine.</p>

                <p>“When you and the others woke from your cryosleep aboard the Odysseus, you quickly developed systems to organize yourselves, right? Distribution of labor and all that.” Luna blinked at Chanam’s question but reclined a bit more.</p>

                <p>“Yeah.” Luna sighed, her own memories returning to her. “The captain and most of the crew were long dead from the half-successful landing. Apparently, the AI was stuck in a feedback loop and only ejected us when the energy stores were running low. It was…messy when we first started.”</p>

                <p>Chanam nodded, watching a few people exit the alcove over two kilometers away. “But you organized. Bartering, as it always does, came about.”</p>

                <p>“I had to sell all my piercings, my books, and most of my clothes.” Luna pinched her nose and massaged her navel. “But I guess it’s a testament to human cooperation that I could sell them at all rather than have my things stolen.”</p>

                <p>“Human beings tend to come together in a crisis.” Chanam watched the last of the eight people leave the cave, magbikes in tow. “Those that prioritize their own selfish desires over the survival and happiness of a community often find themselves looking down the wrong end of a barrel. That’s the duality of economics. It starts out as a way to help organize resources, but it allows the greedy a place to flourish. Using only what you need is a way to reduce stress on resources, so communities can properly thrive. So why use bullets?”</p>

                <p>The Ranger and his ancestor watched as six magbikes kicked up clouds of dust as they sped away. Chanam counted his breaths for nearly a minute.</p>

                <p>“It’s just the most efficient.” Chanam finally answered. “Some of the stuff you mentioned is possible but is only ever ‘worth’ the cost of use on large targets. It takes resources and manpower that could better be used elsewhere.” He picked one of the .50 caliber rounds he’d just emptied from the magazine and held it up for Luna to see. “One of these costs around six terratts. With the software I have in my head and the OAD — ” Chanam pointed to the floating ball observing them both. “–As my spotter, I never miss a shot. Six terratts to put down almost any enemy I can see within ten kilometers, with my own choice of payload, in any habitable atmosphere. Bullets are easily stored chemical reactions. Plasma would diffuse and cool, nanobots are expensive and risky. Lasers and railguns would cost several hundred terratts to have any effect.”</p>

                <p>Luna’s eyes widened. “Right, because currency and energy are the same! It’d be like firing a silver bullet!”</p>

                <p>Chanam nodded, and put the two spare bullets into his back pocket.</p>

                <p>“Cover your ears, Luna.” Flipping a mental switch, his own cochlear implants protected his eardrums.</p>

                <p>The Ranger fired. He watched through the OAD’s telescopic lens as the biker at the tail had their back cave in, bike sputtering to a stop. The spent casing was ejected. Before it hit the dusty red ground, another shot rang. A pair sharing a bike shared a fate as the tungsten-tipped round ripped through them both. The first gunshot’s echo had finally reached them, and the bikers began looking about.</p>

                <p>Not swerving yet, so they weren’t professionals.</p>

                <p>A spent casing was ejected, and an unfired bullet followed. The next shot entered a biker’s chest from the side as they began to swerve too late. The bullet exited the other side and nearly tore off the dead man’s arm. Even if they swerved, a Ranger’s Class 1 predictive shooting software was not so easily tricked. Another pair sharing a bike died before the last two decided that swerving wasn’t helping and began gunning out of the valley as fast as their magbikes would allow. The two were neck-to-neck. One looked worriedly at the other…before the bullet flew through their heart. The last looked back at the corpse for only a moment before hunkering down more. The last shot fired, and the biker saw a puff of dirt erupt besides them. They kept going.</p>

                <p>Chanam picked himself off the dirt and dusted himself off, watching the survivor rush off into the fissured valley.</p>

                <p>“Did you waste the last bullet?” Luna asked as she helped him pick up the casings and the two unfired shots. “I’ve never seen you miss before.”</p>

                <p>“The last bullet was a payload with a tracker. It cost me about fifty terratts, so let’s go grab the payload as we recover neural backups of the pirates. They can pay back their new bodies with hard labor and by cooperating with the colonial authorities.”</p>

                <p>“So the tracker…?”</p>

                <p>The OAD projected a map of the valley with a blinking dot moving away.</p>

                <p>“This colony may not have satellites yet, but the tracker will help us find their base, and eventually, all the places they dammed up the river. They won’t be holding the colony’s water supply hostage for much longer.” The map shut off and Luna gave a wry smile.</p>

                <p>“I guess I can see why the mayor was so happy when you flashed your badge. Rangers really do get shit done.”</p>

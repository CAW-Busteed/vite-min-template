                <p>“BEHOLD, PEASANT!”</p>

                <p>The apparition boomed in a strange accent as it floated a few feet away from Othar. It’s flowing robes were as transparent as the rest of his body, and although Othar could understand what the ghost seemed to say, he knew he wasn’t hearing anything. Had he been a few years younger, Othar would no doubt be scared. But he’d matured and experienced quite a few strange things; a calf born with two heads, mushrooms that made it seem like everything was melting, an amicable tax collector…A spirit was new, but the farmer had the sense that he wasn’t actually there. Like a memory forced onto him, the ghost floated there, pompous, loud, and angry. Well, maybe not like a memory, more like a fly he could not swat.</p>

                <p>Othar focused back onto the spirit. If somebody had come back from the dead to talk to him, it must have been important.</p>

                <p>“ — AND LONG I HATH STUDIED THINE LANGUAGE SO THAT I MAY SPEAKETH TO THINESELF AND COMMUNICATE A TERRIBLE TRUTH ABOUT THINE PROGENY!”</p>

                <p>“Wait, hold on, how could a spirit know about kids I don’t have?”</p>

                <p>There was a pause as the spirit looked confusedly at Othar. He seemed to make a few waving movements and taps with his hands as he muttered something in an undecipherable language. Othar looked on curiously, leaning on his hoe as the apparition gesticulated wildly.</p>

                <p>“[Dammit, I thought the translation software was working? I fed it a bunch of early seventh century Slavic texts to help optimize translation…]”</p>

                <p>“And you can speak without yelling? What’s that about? I’m right here, you don’t have to scream.”</p>

                <p>Stunned, the spirit looked at Othar before clearing his throat.</p>

                <p>“QUIET MORTAL! I ART MERELY SPEAKING INCANTATIONS TO…ER…PROTECT THINE FEEBLE MIND IN MINE PRESENCE AS I WARN THEE ABOUT THE PAIN YOUR DESCENDENT WILL BRING TO THE WORLD!”</p>

                <p>“Why did you clear your throat?”</p>

                <p>“WHAT?”</p>

                <p>“Your throat. You cleared it before talking. I don’t think ghosts need to breathe, let alone clear their throats. Are you actually a ghost?”</p>

                <p>“[Aren’t seventh-century peasants supposed to be superstitious morons? Couldn’t this jackass at least be scared?]”</p>

                <p>Othar frowned. He may not have been able to speak the strange being’s language, but he could tell when he was being insulted.</p>

                <p>“Listen, if you want to yell at me about having kids or not, I get enough of that from my mother, from my preacher, and sometimes from my wife when she’s had too much ale. If you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some dirt to till.”</p>

                <p>“HEED MINE WARNING, MORTAL, LEST YOU BE CURSED. DO NOT LET THE SEED ESCAPE FROM THINE LOINS OR SUFFER A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH.”</p>

                <p>Othar rolled his eyes and picked up his hoe to keep tilling.</p>

                <p>“Yeah, yeah.” He said, ignoring the ‘ghost’ as it gesticulated wildly in his direction, miming all sorts of terrible fates. “The last person who threatened the village with a curse broke his tooth on some old bread and died of the rot. Forgive me if I’m skeptical.”</p>

                <p>“THAT WAS BUT A MORTAL MAN! AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM BEYOND MERE MORTALITY. I CAN BRING DROUGHT TO YOUR LAND, PESTILENCE TO YOUR CROPS.”</p>

                <p>Othar pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. He picked up his hoe and pointed at the apparition. “Prove it.”</p>

                <p>“…PARDON?”</p>

                <p>“I said prove it. You want me to not have sex, but you have the power to bring drought and disease…why not just make me infertile? Or kill me? You’re trying to convince me to not have sex for some weird, almost perverted reason. But if you can make it rain right now, I’ll consider it.”</p>

                <p>“I WILL NOT AID YOU WITH RAIN.” The being fidgeted and tried not to look at Othar.</p>

                <p>“Then make it snow.” Othar gave a smug smile as the being continued to do nothing but avoid eye contact. Othar nodded and went back to work. A few minutes later, the being approached Othar again.</p>

                <p>“I shall be honest with mine intentions” It spoke at a normal ‘volume’ now, looking sheepish. “I am no spirit, but a [transmission], or a memory from a time yet to pass. I art not here, cannot be here, because [matter], or nothing real, can enter the past. Thus, I am sending ‘information’ to the past to warn thee: Thine distant descendent is a parasite upon mine society, and mine intentions are to remove him from existence.”</p>

                <p>“Okay, wow.” The farmer glared at the being. “I don’t know why, but that sounds worse. You want to remove my entire bloodline because my great-grandkid in the far-off future is an ass?”</p>

                <p>“Not thine great-grandchild. Thine descendent, nearly two millennia in the future. Far enough to be of a practically different family.”</p>

                <p>“That’s so much worse. What did this guy do that requires you to go so far back to prevent him from existing?”</p>

                <p>“I would have aimed for his direct sire had there not been…rules in place.”</p>

                <p>Othar raised an eyebrow at that. Whoever this was, they spoke and acted like one of the nobles that had visited the village a few months ago to claim some ‘right of first night’ from a newly married bride. Neither Othar nor the other villagers had ever heard of such a thing, so they got the lordling drunk enough to sleep with one of the more expensive prostitutes of the town, all on his own coin, and convinced him he’d slept with the bride. In other words, he was probably some sort of scammer that often got tricked in turn. A regular moron. Incredible they’d still exist so far in the future.</p>

                <p>“I can see that thou art doubting mine words. Behold! Your descendent in all his corpulence and sin!”</p>

                <p>The apparition distorted and shifted until Othar could see an image of an overweight man facing him, reclining on a seat as he ate some bright orange curls. He lay there, wearing nothing but a strange tight loincloth that left very little to the imagination. In between Othar and his descendent was a table covered in clear bottles of liquids ranging from a sickly green to bubbling brown and strange, thin bags that seemed to shimmer and shine like fish scales on the inside. Nestled between bottles and bags was a device, about as long as Othar’s arm and twice as thick, but very much flat, segmented into finger-tip sized portions organized in rows, each labeled with a different type of script. Othar could see a large bed with thick covers and pillows a couple paces behind him, as well as a shelf containing a variety of brightly colored little statues varying between women and odd creatures. In a pile by the bed, Othar recognized what seemed like a bunch of books that were very much not Bibles. Unless the Bible in a millennium was decorated with scantily clad women wielding swords, which Othar admitted would have made it more interesting. There was also a strange, almost grating sound playing, with heavy beats and discordant tones. Othar didn’t like it, though he had to admit there was a rhythm that his many-greats-grandson was bobbing his head to.</p>

                <p>“He seems well-fed. That’s good.” Othar nodded.</p>

                <p>“Well-fed!? Thine progeny is fat! Bloated like the [Michelin] man, like a corpse left too long in the [sewer]!” Othar could not see the ‘ghost’ but he could hear him as his voice replaced the sound of discordant music and Othar’s descendent crunching on food.</p>

                <p>“Have you ever been starving?” Othar glared as he remembered the harsher winters of his youth, the winters he prayed the hardest for food, the winters he helped his father bury younger sisters and brothers. “Starving enough to consider eating anything? The kind of hunger that twists your stomach into tight knots and wrings out everything? Where the pit in your stomach digs deeper into the night, a reminder that you may not wake the next morning?”</p>

                <p>Silence.</p>

                <p>“I didn’t think so.” Othar concentrated on the one who would follow him many years in the future, taking in every detail. Othar could swear they shared a few features, though it could have been his imagination. His eyes trailed down a massive scar trailing from his chest to a few hand’s widths above his navel. An injury that would have been a death sentence to anybody now. “What’s his name?”</p>

                <p>“What dost it matter? He lives in hedonism and sin! He is a vile creature of debauchery that still lives with his mother!”</p>

                <p>“So do I, though? Who’s going to take care of her when she grows older?” Othar began pointing out what he could see. “He’s got a big bed of cloth, books, and a variety of strange potions that seem like they taste more interesting than any ale. From what I see of this room, he’s set. What are those little statues?”</p>

                <p>“The [anime figurines]? They art…sinful little statues from an [animated show]…stories?”</p>

                <p>“He has enough money to commission these made for him AND have a minstrel band play that awful music?”</p>

                <p>“They art not that expensive. And no, neither was made specifically for him. They art…[mass produced]? [How do I explain the internet and streaming music to somebody from before mass communication, in a language that lacks the words]? Augh! There are no minstrels there, it is an illusion he conjured up himself!”</p>

                <p>Othar nodded. Despite the ‘ghost’, Othar was quite happy with his descendant’s lot in life. Othar had a few thousand questions, but the biggest was still on the forefront of his mind.</p>

                <p>“Okay, but what has he done to you or society? If nothing he has was meant for him, then he can’t be the only one with ‘aneemay feeguhreens’ and that music, right?”</p>

                <p>The image of the descendent faded away and was replaced once more by the angry ‘spirit’. Almost frothing at the mouth, he began to shout once more.</p>

                <p>“HE IS WRONG!” The ‘ghost’ took a few calming breaths. “He hath claimed something truly inane and stupid, and I, in mine wisdom, sought to correct him to protect mine honor. Alas! He hath ignored me and got his disguised friends to insult me. Aaaand make mine claim and mineself look stupid!”</p>

                <p>“Wait.” Othar parsed through what this maniac was saying. “You’ve developed a way to swim up the stream of time to talk to people of the distant past because you had a disagreement?”</p>

                <p>“No, I borrowed a [program]…spell? Because he is WRONG! And I was insulted in a public forum — [Wait, why is ‘forum’ properly translated? Whatever.]”</p>

                <p>“And why would his friends be disguised in a forum? Are you sure you didn’t get called out for your bull from the rest of the people there?”</p>

                <p>The being’s face began to turn red, and Othar could swear he saw a vein throbbing uncomfortably fast on his forehead. Just as he opened his mouth to say something, another voice, gruff and authoritative rang out.</p>

                <p>“[TEMPORAL CRIMES BUREAU, OPEN UP!]”</p>

                <p>“[SHI — ]”</p>

                <p>Without anything else, he was gone. Othar was left there, gripping his hoe with more questions than answers. But the answers he did have mattered far more anyways. Sometimes he worried if the sun would still rise in the morning, or if his family would be okay, or that the world could keep going after he was gone. If there were still small-minded idiots in the future, Othar mused, then that meant the world kept going no matter what.</p>

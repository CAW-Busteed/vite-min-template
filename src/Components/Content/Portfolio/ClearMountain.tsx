                <p>As silverwood forests of Chroma burned, I still regretted my exile from the elven kingdoms there. All my life, I was told to listen to my betters and elders as they set the tinder to our homes. No amount of warnings, no matter how much I proved myself, was enough to change the mind of my stubborn kin. No matter how I excelled, no matter how much glory I brought to the high elves, I was met with flowery words and practiced smiles. Now, their bones and groves were ash trodden beneath the armies of the Conqueror King. No more high elves would be born in Chroma. Sun Auric had seen to that.</p>

                <p>Lun’s journey in the sky was uneasy, as if she sensed the fears of every elf in Prisma. To humans, she looked like nothing more than a pale ball of soft blue or white, swirling etchings on her surface. Those who could see the energies of the universe witnessed her skittishness; her fins were still, her tail moved in anxious strokes, and her mouth gaped open to absorb as much chaotic energy as possible. All the elves could see the Great Koi was nervous. I watched her, the dry cold sucking the blistering heat of day from my skin. Sand whispered behind me, and when I turned around, there was a human there. He froze when he saw me.</p>

                <p>“Hello.” I’d met him a few times before. Zadryn didn’t speak truetongue, but I learnt the human tongues when they first appeared, millennia ago. It was only recently that they managed to codify a complete language. A simpler one that didn’t take decades to learn, without as many restrictions as truetongue. It was a bit rough, but it was quite clever.</p>

                <p>“Priestess.” Zadryn bowed, his wares jingled with every movement. It made me wonder how he got so close so quietly.</p>

                <p>“No need for that, Zadryn.” I smiled and prompted him to set next to me atop the dune, facing the Jaws to the north. The mountains were as sharp as fangs, reaching a few kilometers high. “What brings you here?”</p>

                <p>“I followed the army.” Zadryn sat down, trying to avoid looking at my face. “I didn’t expect it to be so…”</p>

                <p>“Big? Varied? Well-trained?” I turned around to stare into the darkness behind me. Behind every dune, there was a battalion waiting to take up arms. Humans, elves, dwarves, even a few argites and goliaths.</p>

                <p>When I first came to Prisma, it was as a high elf in exile. I was given a troublesome colony with more deserts, swamps, and mountains than arable land. But those that followed me here were loyal. And over time, as successive generations of elves aged and died, I was able to shift opinion. Dwarves became respected. Local city-states of argites joined my queendom as friends. Goliath tribes traded for weapons and alcohol only to settle among us. Humans were given the freedom they deserved. I lost friends to age and bigotry. But the little penal colony that was given as punishment grew into a magnificent country with a thriving culture. Farmlands and pastures grew from the swamps into the mountains and desert, until there was nothing left but a barren strip of land to the north.</p>

                <p>Over time, the dead land had become a beacon to all those seeking equality. A symbol of what could be accomplished when a high elf abandoned pride for progress. Of course, it wasn’t perfect. When I called for an army to be built after Sun Auric conquered his first kingdom, the high elven nobility that had come to gather beneath the might of a high elf sage scoffed. He was a continent away! He had to deal with all the other elven kingdoms and empires in Chroma! It was as if I was a little girl again, belittled and mocked for speaking up. A few even hinted that my views on egalitarianism were foolish. I made it very clear that my orders would be followed. A high elf without horns is far more receptive to my commands.</p>

                <p>When Sun Auric did not fall, even after three decades of war, my nobles became more skittish. A few made excuses and even migrated north beyond Midbark. As my warnings became reality, more than enough fell in line. And the people I grew my country for had come to agree. It was something to die for. Even the humans agreed to fight their kin to preserve what we’d built together.</p>

                <p>“They are something to behold.” I hummed and closed my eyes, feeling the glow of Lun’s light on my ivory horns.</p>

                <p>“Where is your husband?” Zadryn asked, looking around.</p>

                <p>“Fled north a year ago.” I traced my horn until I came across an empty spot where his ring once was. “He was the third high elf I married. He spoke such beautiful words as he whispered in my ears, but never the words I wanted to hear most in truetongue. Cowards always speak so much.”</p>

                <p>“I’m sorry.” Zadryn finally sat down besides me. “Was he your seventh?”</p>

                <p>“For a merchant, you are remarkably well-informed about my personal life.” I felt a smile dance across my lips.</p>

                <p>“Who isn’t interested in hearing about the Bright Star Queen, She Who Brought Hope to the Desert?” Zadryn took off his pack and pulled out a pipe. “Is it true you killed your first husband after he failed to satisfy you in bed?”</p>

                <p>“Ha!” I let out a bark. “Lusairr’ was a prideful man who hated the fact he was exiled with me. He wed me for my name and power. But when he couldn’t control me, his heart grew dark and malicious. I simply told him he valued our time in bed together far more than I did, and he tried to kill me.”</p>

                <p>“So, yes.” Zadryn seemed shocked.</p>

                <p>“You make it sound as if I killed him because the coitus was lackluster.” The scar Lusairr’ left me as a goodbye present itched as we talked about him. “My second husband was an elf, and he may have truly loved me. He was assassinated by some fool with delusions of superiority. My third, I married exclusively to spite the dead fool’s supporters. A goliath. Now he was a gentleman. Took about a year for him to explain that he was actually a she.”</p>

                <p>“No.” Zadryn’s pipe fell out of his mouth. He picked it up and struggled to cast a spell to light it. He waved his hands and spoke the words, but there seemed to be no fire. After a few seconds he gave up, staring dumbfoundedly at his pipe. He almost seemed to want to gesture for me to cast the spell for him. I ignored him.</p>

                <p>“Goliaths seem monogendered, but that’s only because they lack the typical form of reproduction. There are males and females, but not in the way elvenoids or even dragonoids would recognize them.” My ears twitched. It was almost time. I continued weaving a spell in secret. “The poor dear was nice otherwise, and we parted amicably.”</p>

                <p>“Priestess.”</p>

                <p>“My fourth was also a high elf. Opesh was smart and well aware of the realities of our political marriage. But he was clumsy to a fault. That’s why we have guardrails now.</p>

                <p>“Priestess.”</p>

                <p>“My fifth was an elf. My longest marriage.” My heart ached for Yettle. I didn’t love him, but to watch a friend waste away from old age at your side was still too much for me. I pushed the thoughts away and continued calling upon the depths behind truetongue within my mind to form an astral chain as I distracted Zadryn.</p>

                <p>“My sixth was…unwell. I’ve heard humans use the term ‘nutcase’ and I find it fits for this elf. He was part of some cult that worshipped blood in my name. I put a stop to that quickly.”</p>

                <p>“Priestess.” I’d been ignoring Zadryn every time he tried to get my attention. Continuing to talk, continuing to cast magic. This time, something was different. I met his eyes for the first time and I saw his heart open before me. He was regretful of something, feet pushing deep furrows in the sand. “Auric is not coming around or under the mountains.”</p>

                <p>My ears twitched.</p>

                <p>“And why should I listen to his spy?” I cast the spell and chains of starlight erupted from the sand below him. His eyes widened and he tried to jump back, but the chains had already caught him in their grasp. He tried to break out, to no avail. When he looked up to me from his prone form, I did not see fear.</p>

                <p>“Because you’re a better ruler. I’ve seen what you’ve made, and I don’t want to destroy it.” Zadryn was speak a truth. But not his truth. I’d gotten very good at finding that. The chains around him squeezed.</p>

                <p>“Because Sun Auric is blind to the possibilities! He dreams of a human world but ignores how without him, we fight and bicker with one another just like the high elves!” Another truth. I still wasn’t satisfied. I willed the chains tighter, but not enough to break his fragile human bones.</p>

                <p>He grit his teeth and spoke not in the human language, but words in truetongue I’d never heard given to me. My concentration broken, Zadryn was freed from the astral chains gasping for air. Between labored breaths, he spoke in the human language once more.</p>

                <p>“Sun Auric…intends to destroy…the largest of the Jaws.”</p>

                <p>Impossible. It had to be. I quickly squashed that idea. Sun Auric was used to redefining the possible. He’d turned gold from a worthless metal used to manipulate slaves into auricalcum, a fearsome metal capable of stopping nearly any magic. He conquered Chroma with nothing more than a small strip of land as his starting point. If he wanted to destroy the Jaws rather than traverse them, he’d be ignoring all the traps and troops I’d hidden in the mountains. I could hear the clatter of steel and rocking of boats on the other side of the mountain range. Then silence. I could feel my horns tingle as magic gathered on the coast.</p>

                <p>“TO ARMS!” I called, my countrymen rousing from the sands and climbing to the top of the dunes. I looked down to the spy. I didn’t know what to feel. Humans did indeed inherit the passion of the dragons. I lifted him to his feet. “Stay behind me.”</p>

                <p>“You…have to…run.” Zadryn wheezed. “He won’t…stop.”</p>

                <p>“I knew he was coming here.” I kept my eyes on the tallest Jaw, behind which the energy was congregating. “He always strikes where his enemy is weakest.” I’d been told no sane leader would defend a coastal mountain range bordering a desert. No normal leader would attack such a place to begin with.</p>

                <p>There was a terrible sound, a roar of ripping paper as a golden light cut through the base of the tallest mountain. Explosions echoed from within the mountain as hundreds of traps were set off at once. Slowly, the mountain began to slide down into the desert. Just when it seemed as if Auric would be satisfied with making a plateau, a pillar of shimmering gold cascaded beneath the mountain. It curled and wrapped around the sky like a gilded tornado before wrapping around the decapitated mountain.</p>

                <p>“It appears the Acolyte of Skorm has gained enough favor to bring a trillipede to bear.” I grit my teeth. I lost many loyal people to discover that a full plate set of auricalcum required a whole Silverwood tree to make. How many elves were robbed of the chance to become highborn to make the massive armor that covered the trillipede?</p>

                <p>As the mighty beast wrapped itself in and around the mountain, more traps were sprung, the violent magic washing off the armor like water from a duck’s back. When it seemed like a golden rope had made a net around the millions of tons of rock, the trillipede stopped moving. And the mountain began to rise. I didn’t look back; I could hear the startled gasps, the hands gripping tight onto weapons, the worried sobs of my people behind me. But they stood firm. Because they believed that the Priestess would save them. The mountain rose high above the new plateau, suspended by golden coil which tightened around itself.</p>

                <p>With my enhanced eyes, I could see the poems and stories etched in the human language all along the armor. I could see the armies pouring out from an ocean dotted with boats. I could see one man with a head and beard of crimson standing tall behind the plateau, wielding an ebony great sword as tall as he was. He pointed at me. The trillipede coiled tighter together.</p>

                <p>“Mages, shoot that mountain!” My voice echoed. A rainbow flurry of spells flew overhead, elemental blasts and lances of energy shearing boulders off the mountain. Practically grains of sand. A few splashed harmlessly against the trillipede’s armor. All the while, I kept my crafted spell layered under levels of enchantments to hide what I was doing. Just as the beast began to extend like a spring, I sent the spell directly into the heart of the mountain.</p>

                <p>The mountain flew, and I remembered what it felt like to experience a cataclysm. Sun Auric was the man who could make mountains fly. I could make them fly longer. The mountain turned meteor blocked out Lun’s light as my spell took hold. The reduced weight caused it to fly far overhead and land kilometers behind us in a thunderous boom that shook most of us to our knees. Dunes collapsed around us as torrential winds swept a wall of sand into our backs and into the air. When it settled, we were still here. I could see Sun Auric scowl.</p>

                <p>Zadryn’s mouth was agape, sand dribbling out his mouth in muted awe.</p>

                <p>“This war will not be as easy as the other ones, King Auric.” I muttered with a wry smile.</p>

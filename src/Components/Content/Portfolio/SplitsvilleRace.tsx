                <p>Iris stretched her calves as Sol peaked over the southern cliffs, her claws tapping impatiently against the ground. She hated being in cities. Buildings rose high, blocking most of her vision from potential enemies, the constant stream of people drew her eyes toward them like magnets…and the noise! The hubbub of a city was louder than a stampede of aurochs, and many times more dangerous. If it wasn’t for the race, Iris wouldn’t be here.</p>

                <p>The dozens of eyes on her body swiveled about, examining the competition. Most of the runners for the event were dwarves. It made sense, Splitsville was less of a village and more of a vast city nestled between the sheer cliffs that separated Chroma and Ultret. A perfect place for dwarves to find ore veins and tunnels into the Underground. Iris tightened her scarf despite the heat, making sure none would see her mouth. The eyes on her arms caught sight of a group of humans, meditating and stretching in the park before the race began. A few of them licked their lips nervously when they spotted her. They’d obviously heard of argites before. She ignored them, instead focusing on the real competition.</p>

                <p>She’d spotted three kirins so far, their large, snake-like bodies obvious in any crowd they towered over. They’d be tough to beat. The eye on Iris’s forehead focused on the streams of magic emanating from an elf plucking the strings on a fiddle as he leaned against a lamppost. The argite’s grimace grew larger underneath her scarf when the magic began to circulate around the elf’s heart, legs, and lungs. Close to the park, there were a pair of orcum. Iris’s eyes traced their thick, two-meter frames as they drank flagons of milk. They had painted their bodies green to hide their status as powerful elite; a Coppercast and a Gilded. The Gilded’s red eyes focused on Iris and he snarled, a glimmer of gold dancing under his skin.</p>

                <p>Iris’s green mane shivered from her scalp all the way to her tail, all thirty-six of her eyes turning away. Rule number five: avoid making enemies in unfamiliar places. In one hand, she separated and snapped together two magnetized stones together, fingers tracing over the smooth surfaces of the stones. Every time they joined there was a satisfying buzzing, cluttering sound that helped ease her anxiety. It would soon begin. Iris put a cord through the holes of the two pebbles, tying her necklace back together and putting it under her tunic. She traced her fingers over her necklace, the feeling of the two iron pebbles stuck together bringing her comfort. Her hand jumped away when an old acquaintance approached her. Iris saw the grinning duskin glide over but pretended to jump when he put a hand on her shoulder.</p>

                <p>“That’s nice of you to spare my feelings like that.” The duskin, Gickle, rustled the feathery black wings on his back, seeing though Iris. “Especially since I beat you in the wastelands last year.”</p>

                <p>“I’d call it luck. You fliers always have a decisive advantage, but to rely on the updrafts rather than trudging through a hundred kilometers of hot sand? How was I supposed to compete?” Iris’s talons clicked against the cobblestone path, tail swinging restlessly. “You always seem so hurt that you can’t sneak up on me.”</p>

                <p>“Oh really?” Gickle chortled, but his right eye twitched. The argite knew she’d gotten to him, and he was about to start one of his monologues. “You don’t seem to understand the majesty of flying! I’ll have you know — ”</p>

                <p>Iris ignored him, her gaze trailing across the park, the cobblestone paths, the storefronts, all the pedestrians and riders. Her muscles tensed with every sudden movement, every strange new event. Two dwarves arguing as their bullfrog mounts butted heads down the street. A subterranean human chasing after the errant gust that had stolen the hat protecting him from Sol’s light. A thief stealing some fruit from a stall as the owner was distracted by an awakened beast trying to pay him in bones. Every now and then, someone would flash an etched pommel, a badge. Guards in plainclothes maintaining order. No doubt they heard that the Courier Guild’s annual race would be taking place in Splitsville.</p>

                <p>“Excuse me…” A zenith-folk woman flapped her white bat wings a few times before they settled down, hooking around her waist. She focused her chocolate-colored eyes on Gickle, whose tirade faded away into nothingness as he stared at her, slack-jawed. “Do either of you know anything about a race that’s supposed to happen today?”</p>

                <p>“I heard it’s quite a sight to see.” Iris jumped in, using courier’s handspeech to warn her rival. Possible authority or guard. “I take it as an opportunity to learn.”</p>

                <p>“We do see a lot of strange folk.” Gickle’s handspeech was quick and flashy. Unlikely, he’d signaled, with a tilt of his head and a mocking smile spoke leagues more than handspeech was capable of. “Look there!” He pointed a corvid in one of their strange machines, whirring above for the past ten minutes.</p>

                <p>Iris’s eyes could see of the crow-person better than anyone else. He was carefully inspecting every crease and pipe of the thing he was laying on, a small book held close in one of his claws and a strange tool in the other. The machine jerked slightly, sputtering a small cloud of smoke and the corvid spasmed in panic, his eyes racing through the booklet.</p>

                <p>“What a wise and noble species.” Gickle hummed in thought. “Dragonoids always seem to have things figured out.”</p>

                <p>“Wow…” The zenith-folk woman leaned over Gickle’s shoulder, her long blond hair tickling his sensitive bat ears. “Do you think he’s here for the race, or just to watch?”</p>

                <p>“Well, I, uh…” Gickle shivered as she practically whispered in his ear. “It depends.”</p>

                <p>Iris glared at Gickle, using the same signal in handspeech over and over.</p>

                <p>Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.</p>

                <p>“It depends?” The woman smiled, her intricately carved ear-ridges flexing upwards in anticipation.</p>

                <p>A carriage was making its way towards the park. Something normal since the Split was rife with carriages, especially so close to the bridge towers from which they descended. But this carriage hung low to the ground, weighed down by a heavy load. Normally, the carriages would be unloaded closer to the bridge towers at a merchant’s warehouse. As Gickle hemmed and hawed, the carriage passed in front of the entrance to the park, only for the axles on both right wheels to coincidentally break, spilling the contents of the carriage across the road. A mess of colored boxes, each no bigger than a cantaloupe, tumbled into the intersection. The dwarven driver yelled something, jumping from his lopsided carriage arms moving wildly in frustration. Some people walked around, rolling their eyes. Other, kinder locals came to help the driver stack the boxes to the side of the road as he grumbled and cussed. Had anyone else been paying as close attention as Iris, they’d have seen the carriage driver’s lips move with truetongue in two spells. The first to break the axles, the second to protect the boxes. The driver took out a black and white kerchief and dabbed his bare scalp as his other arm continued to motion angrily, his hand surreptitiously signing two words.</p>

                <p>Gather. Ready.</p>

                <p>Gickle and a few others stiffened. This was the first trial. Being aware enough to recognize a drop off. If you reacted too quickly, a deal would go bad. Too slow, and you suffer the consequences.</p>

                <p>The dwarf snapped his black and white napkin. The signal. All at once, people from the park, the nearby road, stalls, and bars exploded into motion. The race was on.</p>

                <p>Iris bounded towards the pile of sealed boxes, leaping over the heads of a few dwarves. A quick scan of the packages revealed important information to her. They were all perfect cubes, but the insides could be vastly different. Delivering a package with a broken product was a disqualification, so choosing the package quickly was part of the challenge. Iris was a bit unique when it came to couriers; she could see inside a some of the packages.</p>

                <p>Dodging a human tripping over himself, Iris grabbed a green package with a flat metal object inside. Light, but could take some jostling. Stuffing it into a sack she’d tied to her side, Iris was only in place for a moment before she burst off again. She smirked when one of the kirin she’d noted earlier grabbed the blue package by her own, twisting and turning its long, powerful body to weave over and through the crowd, faster than anybody else could react. Like a reptilian bolt of lightning, the kirin rushed north, galloping through the streets at a breakneck pace. Couriers weren’t the only ones rushing; guards unsheathed swords and flashed badges to chase after all those who grabbed a box.</p>

                <p>Gickle swooped in to grab a package, only for the zenith-folk woman to pin his wings behind him with a sadistic smile as she dangled her guard medallion in front his face. He should have listened to Iris’ third rule: never let a pretty face distract you. The two orcum each grabbed a package and began jogging after the kirin, bowling over a half-dozen guards trying to block them. The corvid leaned forwards in his machine, causing it to zoom downwards…and crash into a stall, throwing him clear into a trough of water.</p>

                <p>As all this was happening, Iris kept at least two eyes on each of the guards trying to stop her, rushing to meet her as her sharp claws clicked against the cobblestone street.</p>

                <p>“You are under arrest for disturbing the peace!” One called as she unsheathed her sword.</p>

                <p>Iris just giggled as she danced around her, feinting a move to her partners right and heading left for the lamppost the elf was leaning against. She was surprised he still hadn’t made a move, until she saw his leisurely grin. Heart racing, her calves released the tension she’d been holding since she got to the park. And she soared. With a mighty leap, she landed on the top of the lamppost. The elf, nonplussed, jumped up to catch her, the magic in his body reacting to his will. Just as he reached above her, Iris jumped again, a coquettish smile hidden underneath her scarf. The elf gaped when her felt her paw land right between his horns, her larger claw playfully brushing by his ear as she leaped a third time, pushing herself up…and the elf down.</p>

                <p>She gracefully landed on the roof and kept running. That was the plan. She was no good at weaving or pushing through crowds, but argites were the fastest in open spaces like the savannahs and plateaus they called home. Unless someone cheated by flying, of course. It made no sense for her to try and wade through the dense crowds below when she could run along the roofs of the densely packed buildings. As she leaped from one roof to the next, shouts of anger echoing from the streets below as couriers tried desperately to escape legions of guards, Iris drank in the sights.</p>

                <p>Spitsville extended farther into the valley than even Iris could see, building of stone and iron meshed in a net of roads that extended from the Stalks, the three towers that reached above the sheer cliffs of the Split. The Stalks themselves were a sight to behold, bismuth hewn into iron and stone like coiling snakes, complex enchantments that spiraled around the towers to the iron and cobalt ‘petals’ at the top, which would open and form a bridge that connected one side of the Split to the other. It was at that northern end that couriers would attempt to reach. Some couriers would try and take the rickety ladders or rope elevators up the side of the cliff, moving from tunnel to tunnel to navigate the labyrinthine mess up the Split. The more foolish would try to climb the vertical face themselves. The desperate and insane would head directly towards the Stalks, the most heavily guarded part of the entire Split. Using the Flower Bridge without paying the toll was a harsh crime in Splitsville.</p>

                <p>Iris didn’t mind being seen as mad. Especially since she wouldn’t be using the conventional roads winding within the Stalks. Running inside a tower full of bureaucrats, traders, and many, many guards wasn’t exactly her idea of a good time.</p>

                <p>The argite jumped to the side, narrowly avoiding the arrow that would have speared her thigh. Iris had run nearly a kilometer atop the roofs, but it wasn’t far enough. She clicked her tongue, showing a rude gesture to the elf aiming at her from the peak of a clocktower in the distance. It was certainly an impressive shot, and the elf that she’d so casually stepped on scowled at having missed. He drew another arrow. Iris jumped behind a chimney and kept running away. She wasn’t here to mollify some elf’s pride. Just as she jumped from one roof to the next, she felt an impact in her back. The lip of the roof hit her in the gut, knocking the wind out of her. As she tumbled down, Iris flipped her body around to protect the package. She landed on something softer than the ground.</p>

                <p>Red liquid was everywhere, and someone was screaming. Iris was dazed, haze almost enveloping her mind as she watched an armored zenith-folk descend towards her. As her mind began to clear, Iris realized two things; she’d landed on a fruit stand that a peddler had spent a lot of work perfecting, and the zenith-folk was the same woman that captured Gickle. She unsheathed a rapier and pointed it at Iris. The argite stumbled off the ruined stall, she and the zenith-folk trying to meet each other’s glares.</p>

                <p>“I can’t believe you two could cause such a mess! Today was supposed to my day!” The human peddler pointed his finger at both of them in turn.</p>

                <p>Iris was crouching, holding a hand to her side, the sulfurous sting of argite blood prickling the noses of all nearby.</p>

                <p>“You’re injured.” The zenith-folk calmly noted, unsure of where to focus her gaze before settling on the ones elvenoids always relied on.</p>

                <p>“Not going to gloat as you did with the duskin?” Iris averted the eyes the guard had focused on, as the other eyes on her body drank in the growing crowd.</p>

                <p>“Do you know how long I meticulously arranged the strawberries and raspberries to frame the dragonfruit? How long I worked on the composition that would entice customers with both fragrance and sight?” The merchant’s face steadily changed from red to purple as he threw his hands in the air.</p>

                <p>“This was not Gickle’s first visit to the Split.” The guard admitted. “The guard has extensive reports on his last…adventure here.” She spat out the word ‘adventure’ as if it tasted like an old Brelk beetle.</p>

                <p>“Then…before you take me in, allow me to pay for damages to this poor, noble, merchant’s stall.”</p>

                <p>The man finally stopped shouting, a smile blossoming on his face through ragged breaths.</p>

                <p>“Finally! One would expect the guards of this city would do better than just cause damage.”</p>

                <p>Iris held up a pouch full of silver talents for all the crowd to see. The guard watched on, puzzled, before her eyes widened in realization.</p>

                <p>“Don’t — ”</p>

                <p>It was too late. Iris threw the pouch in the air, a cascade of silver raining down into the crowd. Before the zenith-folk could continue, Iris hurled a half-emptied squib into her face, argite blood stinging her eyes as the crowd descended into chaos.</p>

                <p>Rule four: An opponent is weakest when they think victory is within their grasp.</p>

                <p>Iris stood up straight once more, running away from the chaos into an alley. She scurried past a pair flirting with one another as they played a game of gairre, jumped over a group betting on a cock fight, and punched the man who jumped from behind a corner with a knife.</p>

                <p>“Why aren’t you climbing to the roofs?”</p>

                <p>The voice in her ear nearly made Iris trip. Felt something shift in her mane and swung her hand over her head to see who or what was hitching a ride. A small green frog dressed in a tiny tunic and little bycoket hat was holding onto her mane and a sheathed sewing needle for dear life. A froggem.</p>

                <p>His bulbous eyes looked around with curiosity and excitement until he noticed the eye on Iris’ hand observing him. He waved heartily, before a jostle nearly flung him loose and he grabbed on to her mane again. As much as Iris wanted to grab him and toss him off, he didn’t seem to want to stop her.</p>

                <p>“What are you doing?”</p>

                <p>“Hanging on for dear life!” The froggem giggled. Iris resisted rolling all her eyes at once, dancing around a man digging through a pile of refuse.</p>

                <p>“I mean, why are you on me?!”</p>

                <p>“Oh, well, it’s a long story. I was looking for the caravan I was travelling with when — ”</p>

                <p>“You were on the fruit stall, weren’t you?”</p>

                <p>“I guess it wasn’t a very long story.” The froggem bowed as deeply as one could when struggling not to be thrown off the back of a speeding creature and continued. “Sir Blip, wandering bard in search of adventure, at your service.”</p>

                <p>“Can’t you find an adventure elsewhere?”</p>

                <p>“No can do!” Blip said cheerily. “Froggem creed is to never let a chance for adventure, journey, or quest go!”</p>

                <p>“Just — ” Iris jumped out of the way of another arrow. On the roofs behind her was the elf again. He quickly hid his scowl beneath a mask of indifferent superiority, the tense pulse in his neck the only tell of his mood. “Fen’s tears, how did he find me?”</p>

                <p>“Maybe because of the glowing mark on your back?” Blip offered.</p>

                <p>Iris’s breath hitched. If he had placed a tracking spell on her he wasn’t a simple elf warrior, but a battlemage. A troublesome opponent that used magic to supplement their martial prowess. This one seemed like he had a focus on archery. It was only a matter of time before he started using spells to have his arrows follow her, or even explode. Once again, Iris regretted all the times she ignored her sister’s offers to teach some basic dispelling magics.</p>

                <p>Her one comfort is that no guard would fire any powerful magic into a crowd. Iris took a sharp right out of the alleys and onto a main road, almost running headfirst into the pair of orcum. The two, a male and female now that she looked closer, ignored her and kept pushing away the crowd.</p>

                <p>Rule eight: taking the path of least resistance is either a boon or a curse, so keep an eye out.</p>

                <p>And while they ran more slowly than the argite, they could push through a crowd like a pair of rampaging boars.</p>

                <p>The elf stopped to draw his bow. The arrowhead began to glow in arcane light.</p>

                <p>“Um, miss argite, ma’am? He’s doing something.” Blip said as he tugger Iris’s mane and pointed.</p>

                <p>“I can see that.” She grumbled. More of her eyes focused on the elf to get an idea of what he was planning. Hues of color and emotion, concept and energy flowed from the elf’s mouth to orbit in hexagonal patterns around the arrow. It was definitely not a safe spell. He smirked. And aimed directly down.</p>

                <p><i>TWANG!</i></p>

                <p>“Look out!” Iris tackled the smaller female orcum directly in front of her, knocking them both to the ground.</p>

                <p>The male turned around to snarl at Iris, but an arrow brimming with arcane energy curved parallel to the ground to zoom right past where Iris and the orcum once were. The arrow continued on, embedding itself deep within the corner of a building…and then exploding, bringing down the side of the building in a cloud of dust. Screams rang out as the busy street cleared out.</p>

                <p>“Screamin’ mushrooms that was close!” Blip exclaimed.</p>

                <p>Iris rolled off the confused orcum, the Gilded helping both her and Iris up.</p>

                <p>“Father…” The younger orcum whispered, shivering. The male shook his head and put a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

                <p>“The knife-eared nutcase just tried to kill us both with one arrow.” Iris clarified, pointing towards the livid elf on the roof a few blocks behind them. He was drawing his bow again. “And on that note, it is officially safer on the rooftops.”</p>

                <p>Iris ran into another, thinner alleyway, jumping from wall to wall until she’d reached the top and kept going. Only a little farther until she made it. The magic in the arrow the elf was drawing dissipated, only to be replaced by a different magic. Iris didn’t bother dodging this arrow as it flew over her shoulder, leaving a trail of blue light behind it. Wary, Iris jumped out of the way, but it didn’t explode, freeze her, or do whatever weird trick mages loved doing. The elf jumped on the line of light, which carried him with the speed of a hawk. Towards her. He was drawing his bow again.</p>

                <p>Iris kicked the arrow out of the chimney it was embedded in and ran, ignoring the yelp of surprise as the elf dropped down. The yell of frustration was almost satisfying if Iris didn’t know that his next shot will probably be his best one. Finally, the spire was close enough. It was still a good block’s distance away from the building she was standing on, but she had an idea. A hand pulled itself up, followed by a glowering elf. He pulled up his bow next, then his legs. Iris backed up against the ledge. Looking over her own shoulder, the Stalks remained closed. The elf wiped the sweat from his brow, took a few deep breaths, and smiled casually as he slicked back his hair between his horns.</p>

                <p>“You know,” he called in a glib tone, “before you, I’ve never missed a target more than twice.”</p>

                <p>Iris closed all her eyes save the ones on her head. “Are you sure? I felt like you were taking it easy on me. That, or tales of elven archery are quite exaggerated.”</p>

                <p>The muscle in his jaw twitched. Rule two: someone who’s tried to kill you will try again, so don’t bother being polite.</p>

                <p>The elf drew his bow, magic concentrating in even greater and more complex patterns than before. Iris let memories of her youth run her by. Running in the grasslands where her tribe hunted. Her family enjoying an auroch over an open fire. Watching a lightning storm in the distance. Finding a burnt tree atop a rare hill, the metals nestled within the roots pushing and pulling at each other. She felt the two smooth pebbles of iron still on her breast. The elf fired. And the world seen only by the most perceptive argites opened.</p>

                <p>Iris could see the energy emitted by every scrap of metal nearby. From the iron arrowhead hurtling towards her, to the massive snakes of metal hewn into the Stalks behind her. For a moment, the moments that Iris lived for, she understood it all, and nudged it. The arrow pushed. The Stalks pulled. And Iris flew. Flipping like a cat, she fell sideways and landed on both paws. Sideways. Looking up, she saw the dumbfounded look on the elf’s face as she stood atop the metal path, a sheer face for any but her. Gravity had a tenuous hold on her, the magnetism she’d adopted into her core keeping her firmly in place.</p>

                <p>The surprises weren’t done. The elf was flipped upside-down as an armored figure with white wings swept from beneath him, grabbing him by his ankle. The eagle-like talons on her legs pulled the elf’s bow from his grip, dropping it to the ground.</p>

                <p>“Fila!” The elf cried. “I almost had her!”</p>

                <p>The face of the zenith-folk woman was a mask of calm, but the steel in her eyes betrayed the rage simmering beneath the surface.</p>

                <p>“That’s Captain Starsworn to you, mercenary.” The elf flinched at her words. “When you convinced me to hire your band, I allowed myself to be blinded by our shared past. I thought you would have changed. Grown wiser.” The captain shook her head somberly. “That was a mistake.”</p>

                <p>As the two were having their moment, Iris decided now was the best time to slink away. Even if she really wanted to know more. As the guard read the charges to her prisoner (with whom she shared a no doubt juicy history), the argite jogged up the side of the Stalk, following the iron path laid out before her. A tremor jolted across the Stalks as they began to bloom, the four branches lowering down from each one to slowly form a path across the Split. Right on time.</p>

                <p>“Awww, I wanted to hear more.” Blip whined.</p>

                <p>“Rule number one: Never ask questions during a delivery.” Iris chided, although she kept an eye on the pair as she ran away, oddly invested as Captain Starsworn held the elf’s hands together with one claw as the two bickered. Until the zenith-folk had enough and clamped her second claw of his mouth.</p>

                <p>Further and further Iris climbed, until she trod upon the meeting branches, walking underneath. The sky was below her, hexagons of smooth cobalt tiles unfurling from within the parallel branches to meet in the middle, forming a solid bridge between the three stalks. A clear road to the end that opened up for only an hour, three times a day. With the bridge complete, carriages and people crossed from one side to the next, the hustle and bustle of thousands of travelers, nomads, traders, and whomever else drowning Iris’s presence in a sea of souls that remained ignorant of the argite running headlong beneath them. An express lane, just for her.</p>

                <p>When she reached the other side, no doubt they were surprised when they saw her walk from over the edge. Iris ignored the stares and found what she was looking for. A cloaked figure, by the entrance of the Flower Bridge, wearing the skull of some fanged reptile over their face. A Surrogate, representing the interests of the Courier’s Guild. Already, the kirin from earlier was handing them the box they’d chosen. Within three strides, Iris was behind him, her scarf hiding the wide smile she wore. The Surrogate held out their arms beneath the cloak, box floating above their grasp. The box opened itself and showed the contents to the kirin. Shattered glass tinkled from within and the kirin snarled out a curse.</p>

                <p>“Delivery was destroyed.” The Surrogate spoke in a soft, unidentifiable voice. “Disqualified.”</p>

                <p>The kirin’s body coiled in displeasure, but they grunted and walked off.</p>

                <p>Iris presented her box with a smile, ignoring the prickling sensation running down her spine as she tried to see who or what was hiding beneath the cloak. No such luck. Nevertheless, the box floated from her grip and opened. Iris held her breath. A metal sundial. No damage.</p>

                <p>“Congratulations are in order.” The Surrogate whispered. “Another victory for one of our best couriers, Iris Eversight.” With their words, a flash of magic soared into the air and burst into a bright rainbow cloud high in the sky.</p>

                <p>“Woah, you’re a courier? I thought you were just a criminal on the run!” Blip exclaimed, climbing up Iris’s mane to look down on her from the top of her head. The Surrogate cocked their head at the sight but made no motion to follow Iris as she leisurely walked away from the curious gazes of the line of people waiting to cross the Split. “As it happens, I’m a bit lost. Do you happen to deliver, erm, people?”</p>

                <p>“Normally no, but you’re small and I’m in a good mood.” Iris chuckled. “Though I’m the best there is, so my services are expensive.”</p>

                <p>“Naturally.” Blip croaked with a smile.</p>

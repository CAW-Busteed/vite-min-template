                <p>Just as the moon waxes and wanes, as the tides flow and recede, time pushes change in a cyclical manner. What was once decaying flesh becomes a part of the soil, germinating into new greenery only to be consumed by flesh that will inevitably decay once more. What was once beneath the waves can rise up and become a mighty forest, only to disintegrate over time into a wasteland of dust and despair. Life will persist nonetheless. An entity watches on, swimming through the streams of time and space in whichever way they desire, akin to a fish in a still lake.</p>

                <p>This being is part of no court, no creed; while its ilk would delight in mischief, simmer in grudges for centuries, or simply protect the smallest of things, they simply amuse themselves in watching. Those blessed with the Sight had given this flitting consciousness many names, unaware of the scope of what they had seen, will see, and are seeing. The name the being liked most was ‘Faireoir’. The name they will like most is ‘Ainsealach’. This knowledge of self wasn’t limited to past and future, out of place themself. The entity was blind to what the mortals would call language and expression, seeing the truth behind the frivolities of material comprehension.</p>

                <p>The being watches from atop a mighty conifer, curling itself around the tree as it lifts its rounded head upwards. Through its seven senses, it observes the vastness of the cosmos and the blue dot that grew smaller with every passing cycle of the artificial lights surrounding the window into the cosmos. The mighty vessel moves farther, transporting life in such variety and scope that it rivalled the ark the mortal forebears had built so long ago to escape disaster. Despite the distance, it could witness all that occurs on the home planet it leaves behind. It could focus its vision to the smallest of material creatures, sipping nectar from the honeydew it had nestled in. It could hear the clamor of the mortal colonies they called ‘cities’ and feel the brush of the mightiest storms upon itself as if it was a gentle breeze. A blink, and the being is elsewhere. It sees a mighty rock split and ignite the earth with hellfire never seen since its conception, bringing about rains of acid and a night that would last years. The death this event had wrought was cataclysmic, scarring the earth forevermore and slaying most of the dreaded red-blooded creatures. Most, but not all.</p>

                <p>The entity loves to watch fire, because fire itself never changes. It is currently watching another fire. An Achtiene whinnies and jumps from house to house, its blazing hooves igniting all and trampling the creatures living within. Some are screaming. Others succumb to the smoke and die peacefully in their sleep. It is a small settlement, one with less than twenty score of the creatures, but they are all running about like ants, making it difficult to count them all. Some go into the blaze to rescue their kin. The Achtiene loves to burn those the most, galloping towards them and igniting their flesh in but a moment. If only they could See, as so many of their ancestors could.</p>

                <hr></hr>

                <p>To say the graveyard was creepy was akin to saying a glacier was a bit slow, or theoretical physics somewhat hard to grasp. Merryvale’s only graveyard was surrounded by wrought-iron fence reclaimed over the decades by great briar bushes crawling their way to the top like the claws of the dead reaching up from their graves. Within, a forest of tombstones sparsely interrupted by great mausoleums grew, waves of thick grass so green it might as well have been black rolled about, a dead storm frozen it the height of the greatest gale. From the sparse few trees, strange dolls and symbols of straw and oak, of salt and iron hung, swaying in a breeze nobody could feel.</p>

                <p>Which of course, made this the ideal place for youths to go to in the dark of the night.</p>

                <p>“C’mon Tim!” Sam said as she reached out a hand to help him over a part of the fence not yet claimed by the briars. “Just reach a bit more!”</p>

                <p>Timothy was short for his age. Despite being an introvert, he allowed himself to be dragged around by his friends, often there to stop them when they went a bit too far. His twin Jacob, was the opposite, having already gotten to the other side of the fence, climbing up and landing first on the other side, his jump from the top cushioned by a particularly thorny patch of briar bush. Lily learned from his mistake and took it slow, aided by Sam, who had been sitting on the fence to help them all up in the first place.</p>

                <p>“I still think this is a bad idea.” Tim said as Sam pulled him up. “This is trespassing.”</p>

                <p>Sam laughed loudly and took the young man into a bridal carry before jumping down, feet first, eliciting a small yelp from Tim. The teens chortled as Sam put Tim down, dusting himself off while trying to suppress the blush of embarrassment that began to dust his pale cheeks. The autumn chill silenced them as the soft breeze whistled between the graves and danced across of a few of the trees, grass dancing in the light of the quarter moon. With it brought the scent of sage and mistletoe, and a small cloud covered the moon for a moment. The teens stopped laughing, and for an instant, they struggled not to breathe as all was still. A small rustle. Even the wind held its breath. The back of Jacob’s neck prickled. A calloused hand grabbed him.</p>

                <p>“AYYYIEEE!”</p>

                <p>Jacob’s shriek rivaled his brother’s in pitch, the person behind him let go as Jacob jumped a few feet in the air, struggling to catch his breath from laughing so hard.</p>

                <p>“Charlie?” Lily rose an eyebrow. “What are you doing here?”</p>

                <p>Their classmate, Charlie, shrugged and smirked. He had the type of laid-back attitude and charm that made him a part of every social circle in their high school.</p>

                <p>“I like the ambience.” Charlie waved his hand to a crooked tree where a murder of crows glared balefully from the branches. “How about you guys? Aren’t you supposed to be at a malt shop with a Great Dane?”</p>

                <p>“Hardy-har-har.” Sam rolled her eyes. “We’re actually here to see the infamous gravedigger.”</p>

                <p>“I figured. Thus, the reference.”</p>

                <p>Tim finished patting his hyperventilating brother on the back and said. “References are the lowest form of humor. Anyways, Sam had heard all sorts of silly rumors about the man, and she pressured us to come along.”</p>

                <p>“Also, Joaquim bet us fifty dollars we wouldn’t go to the graveyard at night.” Lily said as she began rubbing her fingers together. “Momma wants that money!”</p>

                <p>“I’ve heard that he has a hunched back, malformed face, and walks about at night in the graveyard chanting.” Jacob moved his fingers in a ‘creepy’ motion. Tim pushed his brother.</p>

                <p>“How stereotypical can you get?” His eyes moved along the scant trees and the graves, stopping a few times on the hanged talismans. “But there’s obviously some pagan influence.”</p>

                <p>Charlie nodded and looked around before saying in a low whisper. “I’ve heard he especially likes to scare the bejeesus out of anyone stupid enough to roam his graveyard at night. That he was born the twilight at the end of fall and the start of winter, which allowed him to see what other humans couldn’t; spirits and fey from the world bordering ours.” A beat passed. Charlie stepped back and loudly said “or he’s just crazy.”</p>

                <p>“Whatever.” Sam crossed her arms. “I’m not leaving until we get some proof. Maybe one of those creepy dolls?” She began moving towards a tree to climb before Charlie tossed something at her. She looked at the charm in her hands before turning towards Charlie.</p>

                <p>“I’ve got a few. I said I liked the aesthetic, didn’t I?” He smiled and picked up his backpack from behind a gravestone. “Now let’s go; I feel like it’s going to rain soon.”</p>

                <p>Jacob cocked his head to the side, his shaggy blond hair making him look like a confused Labrador. “How do you figure that?”</p>

                <p>As if on cue, little drops of rain began to pitter-patter against the gravestones, dappling the trees in a gentle chorus of rustling leaves.</p>

                <p>“I’ve just got a good feeling about these types of things.” Charlie winked. “Now come on, there’s a nickel and dime store nearby to get some umbrellas.”</p>

                <hr></hr>

                <p>The being of many names, sometimes known by Ouroboros, sometimes referred to as Ainsealach, knows the fey of the Unseelie Court are getting tempestuous in this period. After all, in the eyes of these long-lived creatures, the large number of them killed in the past few centuries seem akin to a massacre, even if it was justified. No creature in this part of the material plane proved so dangerous, even considering the natural advantages their iron-rich blood gave them. The cetaceans are just as clever, if not more so, but lack the brutal efficiency of the hominids. These thinking apes kill fey with such vigor, and for so many reasons. For glory, for gold, for the might of their god, from fear, from avarice, and even from desperation. Only the trickiest of fey on the material plane survived the onset of the new age of iron homes, electric lights, and ever-growing technology. Goblins and redcaps went first. Then went ogres, trolls, and all the fey reliant on the physical world to manifest themselves.</p>

                <p>It is for this reason that a faction of the Unseelie Court starts to act up, even going so far as to slay other fey. Seelie Fey and man alike burned together in this little settlement. And the humans remain blind to the dangers that lurk in these fires. The older, wiser members of the Unseelie court would swallow their pride and hide the evidence of fey activity; they know too well how angry humanity can become when facing a common enemy. Sight or not, those blinded by rage burn far more of their perceived enemy than those tainted by compassion or understanding. Ainsealach had seen it all before, and Faireoir will see it all again. The blind will lead the blind into an ark of fire and fury.</p>

                <p>But here comes one who is not blind. Running as if the Wild Hunt were on his heels, running from a place of those past-dead towards those of future-death. Smelling of sage and mistletoe, the man leaps into a fire to save another, deftly dodging the trampling hooves of the Achtiene. He throws salt into its muzzle and it whinnies as it jumps back. He pulls yet another victim out of the inferno, patting this one down in sage essence, throwing a sprig of mistletoe into a fire whenever he can. Slowly but surely, others come to his aid and begin to help their kin out of the burning buildings. Some don’t come back out. But most do, with others by their side. The Unseelie fey are outraged by the one who bears the Sight, ignoring the others in favor of trying to burn, smash, or push him to an untimely demise. But he meets them at every step, throwing the appropriate talisman for every kind of fey. Iron shavings, a lock of hair, silver pellets, rice, and so much salt. He doesn’t simply stop to save his own kind, but the trapped Seelie fey as well. Kind old boggarts, unconscious pixies, household lubberkin, and even ancestral Dőkkálfar. When he is rescuing a youngling from a taller house, a fey manages to push a piece of flaming lumber onto him. He manages to jump out of the way. Mostly. One of his legs is crushed. He screams in agony. Fire sears flesh, bones jutting out of his injury. His howl is visceral, echoing throughout the small town of Merryvale. Help comes quickly. Others manage to pull him and the girl out of the fire, to safety. But the leg is mostly mush, ripped into meat and sinew. The malicious fey whinny and snarl from their fires, raging at the interruption to their wanton destruction.</p>

                <p>Ainsealach had seen it all before, and Faireoir will see it all again. Such is the nature of time; the same stories, repeated over and over.</p>

                <hr></hr>

                <p>“So, I’m back. Mostly because I don’t know who else to turn to.” Jeremy was lying back on the leather divan, eyes trained on the awful popcorn ceiling as his hands skittered about like spiders. This was the ‘office’ of Mr. Hudu, the gifted spiritual healer, born Hubert Crowley. And an old friend of Jeremy’s.</p>

                <p>“Listen Jeremy,” Hubert sighed, “It’s hardly a problem. You have memory lapses, it’s not that uncommon.” Normally, Hubert would speak with a heavy African accent and use plenty of colloquialisms and metaphors when dealing with a client, to better sell his shamanistic ‘mystique’. But Jeremy was a friend, and already knew that was all bull. Well, most of it. As Mr. Hudu, Hubert did end up helping people, in his own way, while making a hefty profit. Jeremy called his clientele ‘rubes’, but Hubert saw them as people in desperate need of help with nowhere else to turn. As was the case here.</p>

                <p>“I’m only thirty-seven, Hubert. And my memory for everything else is as pristine as ever. I remember the meeting with the CEO three months ago as if it were minutes ago. I remember everything and everywhere I’ve been for the past six months. You know my memory has always been impeccable. But now people close to me say I’ve been doing things I don’t remember doing, couldn’t possibly have been doing. A month ago, people were talking to me about things I’d done for them, and I just thought it a case of mistaken identity. But then more people came forward. How I shoveled the snow from my neighbor’s driveway. How I bought a sandwich for a homeless man. And it started getting worse.” Jeremy shuddered.</p>

                <p>“How so?” Hubert prodded.</p>

                <p>“I apparently picked up my youngest from kindergarten while I was in a meeting across town. I practically filled up the refrigerator with food for a neighborhood party at our place, despite the fact I hate my neighbors. I brought my daughter to a baseball game as I was securing a deal in China! I didn’t even know she liked baseball!”</p>

                <p>“Those seem like good things, though.” Hubert gave a smile, his gold-capped canine glinting in the natural daylight of the open window, a relic of an age where the two messed about during their high school years. “Maybe you’re changing for the better and you can’t help but feel as if these changes aren’t a fundamental part of who you are? Sounds like imposter syndrome.”</p>

                <p>“I thought you were a witch doctor, not a psychologist?” Jeremy cocked an eyebrow.</p>

                <p>“You learn to pick up things in my line of work.” Hubert shrugged.</p>

                <p>“Speaking of picking things up…” Jeremy ruffled through his suitcase. “I took the initiative to do some research. And I found a load of documents about people feeling the same thing. Dates go way back.” He pulled out a manila folder full to bursting with printed web pages. “You know about doppelgangers, right? I’ve done some research on them; they’re sort of like changelings and they — ”</p>

                <p>“Leave the mumbo-jumbo to me, Jeremy.” Hubert sighed as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “I think it’d be best if you laid off work for a while. Reassess yourself. Do you think the you of two months ago would have believed this nonsense?” Jeremy lowered his eyes. “I thought so. Thus,” Hubert cleared his throat and put on his accent, “Mr. Hudu recommends you take a small vacation to clear the evil spirits from your mind.”</p>

                <p>That got a chuckle put of Jeremy as he sat up and shook Hubert’s hand before leaving. Hubert stayed in his office for a few minutes before pulling a skull out from a cupboard. He smiled at it, its own macabre grin glinting with the gold-capped canine it shared with the man.</p>

                <p>“Your friend is far cleverer than you were, Hubert.”</p>

                <hr></hr>
                <p>He knocked on the bar counter. He was the only one left in the bar, so of course the bartender would come over.</p>

                <p>“Another.” The man mumbled, his dark blue eyes staring into an unseen distance, ignorant of his wet reddish-brown hair coming down in messy rivulets. He had come in from the rain hours prior, but he was still wet.</p>

                <p>“We’re about to close.” The barman frowned, his own bushy mustache bobbing up and down as he spoke.</p>

                <p>“Please.”</p>

                <p>The barman sighed as he began preparing another shot of spiced rum. In a deft movement, he unscrewed an unmarked bottle of dark amber liquid, within which floated several curls of cinnamon and allspice. He poured the liquid gently in a glass without leaving a drop of the bar itself.</p>

                <p>“Where you from?” He asked as he slid the shot to the man.</p>

                <p>“Family came from the Netherlands after World War I. I’m a bit more local.” The man swigged down the shot; his clean-shaven, square chin pointed straight up as he took the alcohol in one smooth motion.</p>

                <p>“Pretty vague.”</p>

                <p>“I’ve learned, especially recently, to keep who I am close to my chest.”</p>

                <p>The bartender raised a bushy eyebrow curiously and poured him another shot.</p>

                <p>“You’ve the look of a man betrayed and full of loss.”</p>

                <p>He nodded.</p>

                <p>“My wife and kids.”</p>

                <p>The barman hummed and sat there for a moment as the broad-shouldered man turned his head towards the door, finished his shot and began to take his wallet out.</p>

                <p>“She ran off with another man?”</p>

                <p>“I would rather say a man a lot like me took them away from me.” The man said as he began to stack a couple twenties on the counter. “I’d like to drink more, but I’ve got a feeling that this is all I can take for now.”</p>

                <p>The barman counted the money, nodding as he found he had been paid in full, with a respectable tip. He was about to thank the man when two police officers entered the bar.</p>

                <p>“Jeremy Sing?”</p>

                <p>The man already had his hands up in the air. “I didn’t do it.”</p>

                <p>The officers didn’t care.</p>

                <p>“You are under arrest for the murder of your wife and two children.”</p>

                <p>Events quickly passed by in a blur for the man, as if he was sitting in front of the television without really paying attention. He’d known what it’d be like since he found them. And since he killed it. His heart had hardened when he realized what it all looked like, the only evidence vouching for him was nothing more than a puddle of brine soaking his living room carpet.</p>

                <p>He was sitting in an interrogation room when he heard the uneven gait, one that he’d recognized as a man walking towards the door with a prosthetic leg. A cheery man opened the door, messy blond hair almost brushing the top of the doorframe. He waved and smiled wide. Another man who’d see me as another easy mark, Jeremy thought. Ripe for those lawyer fees that I’m going to have to pay.</p>

                <p>“Jeremy Sing?” The man sat down in front of him. “I believe you’re innocent. Which is why I’ll be representing you for a reduced cost. Normally, my clients call me Mr. White, but I believe you can call me by my first name.” He held out his hand. “Call me Charlie.”</p>
                <hr></hr>

                <p>“Was it just me, or did it seem like things weren’t going in our favor?”</p>

                <p>Jeremy said this as he bounced a ball against a wall, trying to avoid the irritation of his ankle monitor chafing against his legs since it was installed after he posted bail. Charlie sauntered over and caught the ball in midair.</p>

                <p>“Normally, I’d say that you were being too pessimistic, considering all the advantages we have and the prosecution relying on mostly mudslinging and circumstantial evidence…” Charlie said without the smile he seemed to wear all the time. “But I fear that you may have a point. The jury is eating it up, no thanks to the supposed character reference they brought in.”</p>

                <p>“I can’t believe Hubert would fuck me over like this.” Jeremy growled.</p>

                <p>“That wasn’t Hubert.” The attorney shook his head. “That was another doppelganger. There was another one in the jury, so that pool is tainted.”</p>

                <p>Jeremy shot up straight. Mouth agape, he seemed to want to ask a question before furrowing his brow and collapsing back into his velvet couch.</p>

                <p>“What about my alibi? My bosses should have my back, right?” Despite putting the defense forward, Jeremy only seemed to sink further in his couch, already sensing the hopelessness of the situation.</p>

                <p>“Don’t count on it,” Charlie sighed. “If the fey could infiltrate the judicial court, they’ve probably covered their bases with your CEO. They love dealing with ambitious humans the most. Your alibi is likely to get ‘lost’”</p>

                <p>“I still don’t understand.” Jeremy said with a grimace.</p>

                <p>“Understand what?”</p>

                <p>“All of this.” He gesticulated vaguely. “Fey. Their existence. Why they did this to me and my family. Why the one I killed just sublimated into thin air, leaving nothing more a bit of dirty water.”</p>

                <p>“We live on Earth; we touch, move, use, eat, and even breathe physical things. When we die, we’re still physical, but whatever made us more than lumps of flesh leaves.” Charlie with his back to Jeremy as he began to finagle with something in his hands. “For the things we call fey, it’s the opposite. The feed on meaning, on the non-physical. And just as the non-physical can’t be strictly be created or destroyed, they don’t have the same ‘death’ we do. They leave behind whatever made it possible to touch, held together by magic, will or whatever, and what made them, well, them gets absorbed by any nearby fey.”</p>

                <p>“Which is why they hold onto grudges for so long.” Jeremy’s eyes widened. “And if they feed on ‘meaning’, as you suggest, then — ”</p>

                <p>“They rely on human emotion, yeah.” Charlie turned his head around to look him in the eyes. “Not exclusively, but a lot. But what can be used to feed them can be used to hurt them. That’s why they’re weak to some things like salt, iron, and mistletoe, but not to sodium, copper, nor even sandalwood. Because despite how close all these things are, they don’t hold the same meanings regarding death, human progress, and protection respectively.”</p>

                <p>“Knowing how to kill one won’t help.” Jeremy placed his head in his hands and massaged his forehead. “If we can’t get a body or anything to prove the fey’s existence, then I’m facing life imprisonment, or worse.”</p>

                <p>“Which is why we have to leave, to go talk with the bigshots in the Feywilds.” Charlie said, beaming.</p>

                <p>“How? Are we going to use some voodoo to get me out of this ankle monitor and into some magic court?”</p>

                <p>“Please,” Charlie rolled his eyes and grinned. “Voodoo is the practice of working with certain fey to determine events that have yet to pass or may never pass. Nothing wrong with that, but I’ve got something a bit more reliable.” He finally turned around and revealed a swiss army knife and what seemed to be a distorted portion of Jeremy’s own garden’s chain-link fence. “Good ol’ mechanical engineering. Hold still.”</p>

                <hr></hr>

                <p>Jeremy wasn’t sure how they got into the Feywilds. All he remembered was getting out of his house and driving towards the setting sun…and they were there. And while some things were familiar, Jeremy couldn’t help but feel confused about everything there, including himself. His thoughts felt as if they were open for all to see, his vision and perspective no longer completely limited to himself. Even the very things he relied on as undeniable truths were turned upon their head.</p>

                <p>As these thoughts ran through his head and fluttered throughout the alien landscape, he could see Charlie set his foot upon a massive wall covered in greenery and keep walking above it, into the twisting horizon above them. Ferns, bushes, and trees moved away from him as if they were skittish animals, some even wiggling about and swimming through the air like eels. Charlie turned around and craned his head upwards to look Jeremy in the eyes.</p>

                <p>“Come along then,” he said with a smile. “We won’t be finding that rogue doppelganger by sitting around and doing nothing.”</p>

                <p>Jeremy grimaced. He didn’t like the fact they had to make a deal with a high-ranking fey of the Unseelie Court to save him from the manipulations of a group of doppelgangers. For Jeremy to work with the person (or in this case, fey) responsible for those who’d ruined his life irked him in ways that words could not properly convey. Fortunately, the nature of the Feywilds made his disposition all too obvious, his angry emotions hitting nearby objects like strikes of lightning. Charlie’s expression fell; he knew enough of the Feywilds to keep a firm grasp on most of his thoughts, as well as see how upset Jeremy was by his circumstances.</p>

                <p>“I understand.” Charlie said. “But this is the best solution. It’s a bit like talking to your boss’s boss to complain.”</p>

                <p>That was true…and considering the state he was in before, with no hope of getting out a free man, this was better. Marginally. Thanks to the Virgil to his Dante, Jeremy had a way to achieve his desires thanks to his guide.</p>

                <p>“Okay then, Dante.” Charlie chuckled. “Need some help on this angle?”</p>

                <p>“No, thank you.” Jeremy shook his head and tried to take a step forwards, before he felt his ears pop as gravity shifted on him, and he nearly somersaulted before Charlie caught him by the torso. “Okay, maybe a little.”</p>

                <p>Jeremy dusted his slacks, which seemed to only get dirty because he expected them to when he fell.</p>

                <p>“What do we do to capture a shapeshifter, anyways? I bet it’s hard to find, let alone catch.”</p>

                <p>At this Charlie smirked.</p>

                <p>“Doppelgangers can be notoriously vain. A bit ironic considering their nature, but it’s something we can exploit by introducing a good modern pastime. And since we’re outside of their patron’s jurisdiction, none of them should be here.”</p>

                <p>It was remarkably easy to set up; Jeremy learned that it wasn’t just doppelgangers that were vain, but many fey took delight praise and beauty. So, when the beauty-contest-turned-sting finally ended with a suspicious fey that appeared to become more and more beautiful every round was tricked into hitting a mirror, capturing them once and for all. The other fey laughed at that, an uproar of chittering and teasing waving throughout them. Until it stopped.</p>

                <p>It was just a small moment, but all the fey were quiet. And then they ran. Roiling masses of fey ran in every direction, trying to get away. It was at this moment a humble fly landed upon the mirror. It buzzed for an instant, but the buzzing quickly grew louder until both men were on their knees in pain. It was only when they both clenched their eyes shut that the fly began to grow and shift disproportionally. When the buzzing stopped, they both looked up to see what looked like a woman clothed in nothing but a cloak of black feathers, her own face obscured by a black paper fan. Her head was tilted towards her feet, staring at the cowed doppelganger in the full-length mirror.</p>

                <p>In that moment, both men knew she was satisfied, just as they knew what she wanted when Charlie proposed the deal. It was time for Circe to fulfill her part of the deal.</p>

                <p>You’ve caught Our faction’s traitor. And your salvation. Approach.</p>

                <p>She picked up the mirror and mimed for Jeremy to approach. Slowly, he inched closer to her until she was within arm’s reach. It was then she closed her fan. Jeremy’s jaw dropped as he stared into the face of his dead wife, her eyes pools of crimson, crying rivers of blood. She gave a gentle smile. And slammed the mirror into him.</p>

                <p>Shards of the mirror embedded into his flesh, but Jeremy couldn’t scream. Gray flesh had covered him and bonded to his body, reducing him to a mute gray mannequin. A hole had formed where his mouth was, a yawning scream that could not be heard as hands without fingers struggled to rip off the flesh. Charlie’s pupils shrank to pinpricks as he stepped back, gasping. But for only a moment. He tried to rush forwards to help him, but Circe appeared in front of him and pushed him to the ground. When he got up again, Jeremy was writhing on the ground, but he began to look more like himself.</p>

                <p>“What have you done?!” Charlie screamed, finger in the fey queen’s face. “This wasn’t a part of the deal.”</p>

                <p>It was. You asked to “be protected from the plans of your faction’s deeds against Jeremy Sing.”</p>

                <p>When she ‘spoke’ her face shifted to that of Charlie’s, repeating his words verbatim back to him, before shifting back.</p>

                <p>We have given your friend the flayed flesh of a doppelganger, giving him the abilities of one of Our own to escape from the plans laid by a few of my subjects. Akin to a selkie.</p>

                <p>“You know very well this isn’t what we wanted!” Charlie pinched the bridge of his nose as he watched Jeremy’s features emerge, worry emanating from him in waves. “We wanted to prove his innocence.”</p>

                <p>But what you asked for was a solution to protect him from Us. We have. What happens in your silly human societies has nothing to do with Us.</p>

                <p>“But — ”</p>

                <p>No more, she interrupted. We have fulfilled Our end of the bargain. Farewell.</p>

                <p>Her image cracked before shattering into a thousand pieces, silver dust disappearing in a wind. Charlie instantly knelt by his friend, now fully reformed as he struggled to catch his breath. His fingernails had cut into his palms, but he did not bleed red.</p>

                <p>“I’m sorry, I — “</p>

                <p>“It’s fine.” Jeremy said, gritting his teeth. The ground around them began to get cold as frost emanated from his hilling rage. “We should have read the fine print.”</p>

                <p>Either way, Jeremy had nowhere to go. Nobody to care for him. The worst part of it all, despite everything pointing towards him, was that he only now realized how much he missed the family he’d been trying to ignore in favor of a successful career. How he’d wished, in the deepest recesses of his mind, that the family he started would simply leave him alone to succeed in the life he’d built for himself. And now they were gone. The only people who had seen him as more than just a money-making machine, who’ve been willing to stick with him through thick and thin, murdered by a hand so much like his own.</p>

                <p>He’d eschewed them for people that abandoned him without a second thought, just to keep their secrets, their money, their damn pride. And now…Jeremy was nothing. He no longer had his own face anymore. He’d have to wear another’s once they got back onto the Material plane. And why? Because some sick fey wanted to get their jollies by torturing people emotionally?</p>

                <p>The ice-cold was gone, replaced by an inferno, before it too was muted.</p>

                <p>Charlie put a hand on Jeremy’s shoulder for a moment before helping him up.</p>

                <p>“We should get back…but maybe it’d be best if you got yourself a new name and face. I know some guys who’d be willing to violate parole and get you some fake ID’s but…”</p>

                <p>“Whatever.” Jeremy grunted, supported by shifting his weight onto Charlie. “Let’s get the fuck out this trippy hellhole.”</p>

                <p>The two walked through the changing landscape, grassy meadows moving in tumultuous waves as morning dew rained upwards into the clear skies. All the while, Jeremy got used to his new muscles and sensations, shifting his shape and body as Charlie struggled to support his friend. He was a bald man with a handlebar mustache and large brows. Then a wispy man taller even than Charlie, with long black hair. Then he was a redhead woman with a scar underneath her lip. Charlie realized while doppelgangers could only imitate, Jeremy himself could create.</p>

                <p>When they left the Feywilds, they found themselves back in Jeremy’s suburban van, on the road with the rising moon behind them. Charlie looked to the driver’s seat to watch a stoic child let the vehicle slow down to a stop, unable to reach the pedals.</p>

                <p>“Have you come up with a name?”</p>

                <p>The child shook his head before stopping for a moment.</p>

                <p>“Perhaps.” He turned to look at Charlie. “Not sure on a first name, but I’ve decided to rely on my old family name. From before we immigrated to the U.S. so many years ago. Sort of…” he squirmed and looked at his swinging legs. “As a way to remember my past, and my family? I’m not sure.”</p>

                <p>“So, what’d you pick?”</p>

                <p>“It’s an old name from the Netherlands. My family comes from a long line of doctors.” He nodded. “Call me Helsing.”</p>

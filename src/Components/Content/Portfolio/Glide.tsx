                <p>I was the only one on the plane.</p>

                <p>On the bright side, there were no crying babies or people elbowing over into my seat, nor people setting up their smelly feet by the window. For all intents and purposes, this could have been a perfect flight.</p>

                <p>It was one of the newer planes too, with touch screens in the backs of the chairs, with a wide selection of new and classic movies. More than enough for any flight, though I did find the selection a bit drab. I was sitting at the window seat, overlooking the plane wing to a silent city on the coast, engines humming omnipresently. Not five minutes prior, I would have been able to ignore it, or be unaware of it. Because then, there was a crying baby two rows away, there was a stubborn git fighting for my armrest, and there was a smelly foot too close to my arm, nestled between my seat and the wall of the plane. There was an air hostess bringing drinks with a trolly, which now sat alone in the aisle. There was a pilot talking in hems and haws over the intercom, interrupted by the deafening engines pretending to be silence.</p>

                <p>I was the only one on the plane. Where did the others go, five minutes ago? Alien abduction? Rapture? A break in causality? Did I dream them into existence and accidentally stop? I did not know. </p>

                <p>Nor did I know how to land a plane.</p>

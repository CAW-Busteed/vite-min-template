                <p>The mother walked around the hut, hanging cutlery up by the fireplace as the smoldering embers faded into dusty gray. Her twins, a son and daughter, watched her with tired eyes as they lay in their bed, waiting for her embrace. The two looked at one another, unspoken conversation occurring between the two.</p>

                <p>They knew they were different from the other villagers. They weren’t elves like them. They grew faster than them, they struggled to speak their language, but…they understood them far better than they had the peoples of the last few villages they’d lived in. Their mannerisms, their expressions, the way they acted around each other…how millennia-old and world-weary walked, how they looked at the world around them. It was so similar to their strange mother.</p>

                <p>Despite this, their mother rarely interacted with them, schooling her expression whenever she went to the village when she desperately needed something. Instead, she sent the twins there to play and learn as she worked. She cut wood, hunted and foraged for food. Among the dwarves, she drank and sang with them after she worked their mighty bellows at their side. She taught the twins how to dance and wrestle with the nomadic goliaths. She hunted alongside the argites and helped braid their manes at dusk.</p>

                <p>But they had their own mannerisms, their own cultures, their own ideas. Their mother had her own, one they had thought unique to their race. Until they met the elves. The expressions they used, the way they walked, the way they spoke…all had echoes of their mother’s own mannerisms.</p>

                <p>As their mother tucked them in, her daughter asked.</p>

                <p>“Mom, what are we?”</p>

                <p>Before she could give her usual answer, her son continued.</p>

                <p>“And don’t say ‘what we need to be’.”</p>

                <p>“You act so much like the elves.”</p>

                <p>“But you don’t like to be around them!”</p>

                <p>Their mother was silent, as she often was. She looked them both in the eyes, her own downcast as lifetimes of memories ran through them. And she sighed. Not one of lost hope, but of repeated resignation. And she spoke as she normally did, with practiced precision and calculated cadence. But rather than being succinct, she prepared to speak more than she had ever had.</p>

                <p>“You’ve noticed how other children have a pair of parents, grandparents, and entire families.” The two nodded as their mother sat on the bed and began to recount a tale. “You have none of that. Only me. Because unlike you two, I wasn’t born.” She lifted her shirt to show her abdomen, one without a navel.</p>

                <p>My creator was a shrewd one. A cruel god that thrived on the misery of others. He schemed and plotted to give me the gift of life and had held it over my head ever since. To repay the debt of life, he paraded me in front of like-minded beings, exposing all of my flaws and proclaiming me the ‘epitome of elvenoids’. To them, my passionate soul and weak body were hilarious. Hair that grew in strange places, soft skin and organs, weak muscles, a lifespan limited by decades, not centuries…I was a joke to them. Tortles didn’t like it, but the kirin did. Reptids were a mixed bag. And the saurians, my creator’s progenitor race, laughed the hardest. And when his audiences grew bored, we moved elsewhere and repeated the cycle anew. But I knew from the moment he named our species, that I would never be honest with him. That was the first thing he gave me, his shrewdness.</p>

                <p>So I showed passion about the stupidest things as I nursed my rage in secret. I would argue with the audience about the weather, about philosophy, about nature. I would argue for the sake of argument, subtly learning as I went. Of course, I have no fangs nor claws, nor strength to back up my arguments, so I was often maimed by the more belligerent crowds. Never enough to kill, but enough to prove I was feeble. When I found my injuries would heal faster and my body grew stronger with every trial, I stayed quiet and injured myself more harshly. When I discovered that my clay body was malleable, I fabricated more injuries and deformities. My creator was incapable of pity, but his own laughter blinded him. I was but a mortal, and he was Gwydionogi, he who had fooled the dragon god. But I could wait. And as I grew older, he had to admit I would die. And his greatest joke, one he had sacrificed so much for, would scarcely last a century. I will not lie, I hammed it up. While my eyesight did fade, and my joints grew sore, my mind remained sharp. I broke my bones more often, even as they grew harder. He didn’t notice until my black hair began to gray. The trick was never to say anything, but to allow the collection of events to form a clear picture.</p>

                <p>This is when I learned what he had given to make me. We went to Kidu for his breath, for which Gwydionogi was spurned with so much anger, Kidu’s own acolytes had admitted there were no records of the Primoradial being so angry. That was the first time I’ve seen anybody feel pity for me. I did not like it. My creator sent one of his own worshippers to parley with Dohremi for drops of his blood. That proved to be a mistake, as Dohremi sent his most vicious children back. My creator ran as he left his believers to burn. I followed, never complaining, limping all the while. Twice he turned back to be sure I was following, and one final time he came back to carry me on his back as he ran. That’s when I knew my life had value.</p>

                <p>He ran until we reached the river he scooped my clay from. He clawed at it, desperately like a madman, and tried making more like me. First a dozen shaped like men, with various tools between their legs, exposed for the world to see. Then a hundred shaped like women, in a manic fit of trying to make more in my likeness. But he could not. His breath lacked depth; his blood lacked power. When he was at his lowest, I apologized to him. Apologized for my frailty, my mortality, all with the reverence of his most devoted acolytes. And I planted the seed into his mind. My mortality was the problem. He left me there, but returned a week later, injured yet smiling, holding a fruit of immortality in his psionic grip. Of course, I pretended to be so infirm that I lay there waiting for him, supping only on the water of the river. And so it was that I gained eternal youth, his second gift to me.</p>

                <p>Our routine continued. He, the jester, and I, the butt of his mockery. But with longevity, came stagnancy. Soon, all his audiences were exhausted of me, and my own short lifespan was no longer the great joke it was. It was as we watched a skirmish between the high elves and the dwarves that I noted that the dwarves may have been individually weaker but worked better as a group. A second seed was planted. He left for a month this time and returned with a pair of stones reminiscent of the light of dawn and dusk, of moonlight and darkness. And as I slept, he cut me open and placed them inside. I awoke in pain, but I could tell something had changed. I no longer needed a male to conceive. The first few were…rough. I would not allow another to be born in my bonds. He’d expected it, that was how I was designed after all. I was stronger than what he’d designed. I had taken my first steps in magic, forging my body to be stronger with every breath. Then, I could smell it in the air. See it in the way Sol and Lun grew close. Hear it on the whispers of the ancient trees. Feel it in the movements of the smaller beasts as they burrowed into safety.</p>

                <p>I carried a child in my belly then, knowing freedom was close. When the sky split apart, when Chaos and Order cascaded down on Arbora as all that was ended, I ran. With child in my belly, with Gwydionogi distracted, I ran. For weeks I ran, stopping only once to in a cave by a bear and her cubs. I had to beat her mate for their respect, but I did so, securing a spot by her side to give birth. And once I had cut the cord, I held my first child to my breast to nurse him as I continued to run. I never saw Gwydionogi again. I had shaped my face and my son’s to resemble that of an elf, and I ingrained myself in their culture. First with refugees left by the Cataclysm, then among nobility as I helped them rebuild their society. I fell in love. I raised my son with his daughter, then ours. My blood was stronger than his; she was human too. Politics happened. I fled but kept a grudge. I changed into a thousand different faces, bore five thousand different children, each from a different father, each masquerading as an elf, each bearing their own human children, each loyal to me. My children and I fractured empires, as I was spoken in whispers among my children, then among the enlightened races. After three generations, humans would not be able to change their faces. After five, they would bear half-humans should they procreate with other races. The mantra I had left them had allowed them to seep into every society, every discipline. When the high elves found out, they tried to purge out the ‘cuckoo’s spawn’, but it was too late. Humanity was here.</p>

                <p>Those days are behind me now, and there exist scattered tribes of humanity wherever we can eke out a place to live. Among the races who would have us, in the wilds, and even still in the slums of the great elven empires reduced by infighting and paranoia of the ‘human plague’. I raise my own children now, although I’m not sure if I will ever take another lover. Heartbreak can kill the hardiest beings, remember that. You must swear now, swear on your seedsoul, that you will never speak a word of this story to any but your children. Many would seek to hurt you simply because my blood runs thicker in your body than anybody else’s.</p>

                <p>Good. Now sleep, children. Repeat the mantra and sleep easy knowing that I will protect you, just as I have my other children.</p>

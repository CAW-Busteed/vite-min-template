                <p>The first of the dragons was a being of desire, made manifest in flesh and flame. Whenever he felt like eating, he would eat. Whenever he felt like sleeping, he would sleep. Whenever he felt like killing, he would kill. It was up to him to stop. As such, he cleared forests of food in days, or ate nothing more than a small root vegetable. He would sleep for centuries, or for a couple seconds. He would kill thinking beings, be they alone or entire tribes.</p>

                <p>Only Primordials would be able to chase him off. But they could never bear to kill him, as he was once their brother. Within a millennium of existence, all that swam, slithered, crawled, ran, and flew feared the dragon Dohremi. When a great shadow would blot out Sol or Lun’s light, all would cower before the Dragon God. For what could they do against the one that was as tall as a mountain, stronger than any storm, breathing fire hotter than any inferno, with a mind vaster than any ocean?</p>

                <p>Dohremi was a being of desire. And as he aged, his desires became more complicated than just physical ones. After all, unfulfilled desire may have been his first death, but fulfilled desire grew stale enough for him to consider a second death. He began to play with his food. He would find thinking prey, trap them between his claws, and offer them freedom if they beat him in a challenge of their choice.</p>

                <p>The lightning leopard Tai was caught as he slept in his favorite tree. Tai challenged him to a race from one edge of the continent to the other. When they started, Dohremi watched Tai run off into the distance, giving him a day’s head start. Two days later, Tai was halfway across the continent when Dohremi passed him. Tai, seeing this, ran away to hide. A day after that, Dohremi found him and ate him.</p>

                <p>The whale from the deep, Ba, was caught in his claws as she surfaced for air. She determined the challenge to be one of intellect and wisdom. They would take turns to ask each other questions until one could no longer answer. After twenty-five questions, Ba could not answer Dorehmi’s question correctly: “What is older than mountains, older than trees, older than Arbora herself, yet it I cannot seize?”</p>

                <p>“Order and Chaos,” she responded.</p>

                <p>“Nothing,” Dohremi corrected, right before he ate her.</p>

                <p>Red the field mouse had accidentally found herself within Dohremi’s home. The dragon god, feeling mirthful, would allow her to leave should she win a challenge of her choosing. “Whoever could fit through the smallest hole would win,” she declared. Dohremi tried to make the hole itself bigger, or himself smaller, and even went around the hole, but he would not fit. Begrudgingly, he let Red go. So it was that a humble field mouse bested the Dragon God Dohremi.</p>

                <p>However, the dragon was proud and unrelenting; he would continue to pester her, catching her again and again to be challenged. Yet time and again, Red would win. “Who can grow the most hair?” “Who could burrow in the field without killing a single plant?” “Who can balance on the smallest branch without breaking it?”</p>

                <p>It was only after Red had won the challenge of “Who can rear the most children” that Dohremi grew incensed. He challenged her to the same game he had beaten Ba with, letting her ask the first question. Knowing that Dohremi would never stop, she asked: “What is the name of the mouse who had beaten you before, whom you intend to kill?”</p>

                <p>Perhaps he was enraged at having his pride trampled, or maybe he had never bothered to remember her name…Dohremi didn’t answer. Instead, he stormed off, roars of anger causing mountains to shake apart.</p>

                <p>And so, time came to pass. Dohremi spent slept within the deepest caverns, gathering treasure and prey in equal measure in his few waking moments. Until something woke him up. What he saw then was beauty beyond measure. Fiery eyes met gentle green as they faced off, Dohremi towering over her. Where his scales glittered gold, hers shone white with sheen reflecting every color of the rainbow and beyond. His carefully maintained amber horns were lackluster compared to her own onyx branches, which curled into beautiful antlers. She was like him, a dragon, yet she eclipsed him in every way. Wary of this other dragon, Dohremi growled.</p>

                <p>“Who are you?” He roared. “Who made you?”</p>

                <p>The she-dragon smiled and responded.</p>

                <p>“I am your challenger.”</p>

                <p>Dohremi was stunned for a moment before a laugh shook the earth.</p>

                <p>“None have been so brazen — so foolish — to ever challenge me! What is your name?”</p>

                <p>“Does it matter? Name the contest.”</p>

                <p>Dohremi’s mirth dissipated. As she was the challenger, he could pick the trial. That was the rule he’d made with every victim. Yet none had been so arrogant as she. Seeking to finish this quickly, and eager to put her in her place, he chose combat.</p>

                <p>Yet, when they began, despite being able to throw mountains and tear apart rivers, despite his breath turning deserts into glass plains, he could not hurt her. Mountains faded to dust upon hitting her, the fire passed over her like gentle streams. She danced around blows like a butterfly danced in the breeze, and when Dohremi did land a blow, his claws and fangs slid off her hide like water from a duck’s back. And she laughed, how she laughed. When all Dohremi could do was insult her, she slipped around behind him and pinned his wings together, slamming him to the ground beneath her. She unsheathed a claw and casually glided across his jaw, easily splitting apart scales, and scratching deep into bone. She stopped right before his throat.</p>

                <p>“Do you concede?”</p>

                <p>For the first time, Dohremi felt fear. He could feel the pulse on his neck being pushed down by a dainty claw and knew his life could end with but the flick of a wrist.</p>

                <p>“Best out of three?”</p>

                <p>But he was still proud. If he could not win through pure strength, then he would win through hunting.</p>

                <p>“I will give you a day to hide. If I do not find you within the month, you’ll have won.”</p>

                <p>“This challenge would only be fair if I search for you as well. Let us take turns. Whoever takes the most time to find the other will have lost. You may go first.”</p>

                <p>“So be it.” Dohremi grit his teeth and closed his eyes for a day. Yet when he opened them, she was still there. He grinned and laughed. “Giving up already? I found you.”</p>

                <p>“I cannot run from you. It’s my turn.” She closed her eyes and Dohremi scoffed.</p>

                <p>Leaving nothing up to chance, Dohremi flew faster than he ever had before, reaching the tallest of Arbora’s branches before morning was done…Only to find the she-dragon there, still with her eyes closed.</p>

                <p>“You cheat!” Dohremi roared. “You followed me before the day was up!”</p>

                <p>“No. I did not follow you.” The she-dragon said. “You still have most of the day, find a better place to hide.”</p>

                <p>Begrudgingly, Dohremi flew even faster than before, reaching the lowest of Arbora’s roots before evening fell… Only to find the she-dragon there, still with her eyes closed.</p>

                <p>“How? Did you trick me? Are there several of you?”</p>

                <p>“There is only one of me yet. Midnight does not wait for you.”</p>

                <p>Dohremi, roaring in confusion, took drastic measures. He flew high, higher than any dared to go, until he escaped Arbora’s embrace and reached beyond…where the law of Order and will of Chaos were unrestrained by Arbora’s influence. Order sapped his strength broke his bones, Chaos burnt his mind and tore his flesh. It felt like a thousand years had passed and none at all. Dohremi crashed back onto Arbora’s forgiving and merciful earth, beaten and bloody. And when midnight came, the she-dragon was there, staring at him.</p>

                <p>“Found you. We’re tied in this trial.”</p>

                <p>Dohremi wanted to believe that. But she never tried, and her lack of effort was equal to his best. But beneath all the rent flesh and grievous injuries, the Dragon-God still had his pride.</p>

                <p>“My last challenge. Questions. I ask, you answer. Then you ask, I answer. First to say, ‘I do not know’ or does not answer within a minute loses.”</p>

                <p>Within the first forty questions, they asked one another secrets only the most ancient of beings would know.</p>

                <p>“Who was made first, Sol or Lun?”</p>

                <p>“Which beings had the first brains?”</p>

                <p>“Who gave what to form every bit of my body?”</p>

                <p>“Where were each of the Primordials created?”</p>

                <p>And so on…</p>

                <p>The next fifty questions only the most wise and intelligent could know.</p>

                <p>“Why does water stick?”</p>

                <p>“What is the nature of time and space?”</p>

                <p>“What are the base components of life?”</p>

                <p>“What separates soul from memory?”</p>

                <p>And so on…</p>

                <p>Then came the ten questions only Dohremi and only the long-dead could answer.</p>

                <p>“Where was Jai hiding when I killed him?”</p>

                <p>“What were the questions and answers Ba gave before you ate her?”</p>

                <p>“Who won my first challenge?”</p>

                <p>“What did Trin the venom snake bring you to curry favor before you killed him?”</p>

                <p>Despite this, the she-dragon answered every question easily. Dohremi, however, was beginning to feel small as she even asked questions he had considered asking her, questions that should have been impossible for her to know the answers to. Then came the questions that Dohremi struggled with.</p>

                <p>“How was I there, wherever you went?”</p>

                <p>Dohremi was quiet for a moment, thinking. She’d said that she hadn’t followed him, that there was only ever one of her. But she never answered his other question. ‘Did you trick me?’</p>

                <p>“Because you were already there, wherever I went.”</p>

                <p>The she-dragon nodded and motioned for his turn.</p>

                <p>For his next question, Dohremi seemed to struggle to choose between two.</p>

                <p>“What did I feel — No, what happened to Jick?”</p>

                <p>“His essence was burnt and transformed into yourself. You are, at the same time, Jick, yet not, as much of him returned to Arbora. Core bits of him were shredded and mixed to form you when you first became. My turn. What…is my name?”</p>

                <p>Dohremi opened his cavernous maw…and said nothing. A minute came and went, and after a silence so thick Dohremi could hear his own heart beat, Dohremi asked:</p>

                <p>“What is the answer?”</p>

                <p>“I am Arbora. Red sent me.”</p>

                <p>With the Allmother before him, after he was beaten, bloodied, and humiliated, all Dohremi could do was bow, finally humbled. This is how he began penance to Arbora and her children.</p>

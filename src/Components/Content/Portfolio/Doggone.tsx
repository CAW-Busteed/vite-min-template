                <p>Franklin boarded the plane praying not for a safe or easy flight, but some strong drinks. He’d flown enough to never fear an accident, but no matter how much he paid or prayed, the result was the same.</p>

                <p>“Relax,” Jackie clasped his hand and smiled. “It’s going to be an easy flight.”</p>

                <p>Franklin rolled his eyes. Saying so did not make it so. A positive mindset could only stand firm against so many cases of crying babies, annoying seat neighbors, and food poisoning. The two walked down the aisle, Jackie nodding to the smiling flight attendant as they passed him.</p>

                <p>“Hi, thank you for joining us!” He was a jubilant young man that didn’t mention Franklin’s own flat, hollow smile.</p>

                <p>They passed drowsy layover flyers with cozy blankets and neck pillows, children playing games on phones and game systems, and one woman trying desperately to stuff her luggage in the overhead. When they reached their seats, Franklin couldn’t help but look at the ticket stubs again. The window seat was occupied by a woman their age reading a book, not an overweight man who’d overestimated how much elbow room he’d have. Behind the empty seats were normal people: not a kick-prone child on enough caffeine to raise the dead. Nor a disheveled man with freakishly long toenails all too eager to slip his hairy feet in any opening in the seats in front of him. In fact, Franklin hadn’t even seen a baby, slumbering or otherwise. No sonic time bombs waiting to wake and wail in shrill screeches as they climbed into the air.</p>

                <p>“See?” Jackie beamed as they closed the overhead. “No problems.”</p>

                <p>“I won’t believe it until we start cruising.” Franklin grumbled as he sat in the aisle seat, his girlfriend taking the middle seat. “There’s always something.”</p>

                <p>Yet as the plane filled up with passengers, there was nothing. Like a school of sardines politely lining up to stuff themselves in a tin, the people were stuffed elbow to elbow without any fuss. Franklin half expected someone to get up and scream something ridiculous about being on the wrong plane or indulge in a newly found fear of flying. Nothing.</p>

                <p>When the flight attendant the couple greeted at the entrance finished his presentation and began explaining when snacks and drinks would come around, Franklin tensed. His hands clenched the armrests until his knuckles turned white. The faintest glimmer of hope blossomed in his heart.</p>

                <p>“YIP!”</p>

                <p>And burst into flames, turning to dust in resignation.</p>

                <p>“Doggone.” Franklin cradled his head in his hands.</p>

                <p>“YIP! YIP!”</p>

                <p>The woman in the middle row an aisle ahead of Franklin was shirking under the quiet glares aimed in her direction. She hushed the creature in the small carrier between her feet.</p>

                <p>“YIP! YIP! YIP!”</p>

                <p>“I’m so sorry, he’s never like this.” She insisted to anyone who would listen, her eyes darting about. The woman brought the carrier to rest on her knees, petting the animal through the fabric and shushing it gently.</p>

                <p>“YIPYIPYIP!”</p>

                <p>“Doggone…” Franklin repeated.</p>

                <p>The flight attendant approached the woman, bending down to speak to her in her seat. There were some whispers, a shrug on the flight attendant’s part, and some shaking heads. Their voices were raised enough to be heard.</p>

                <p>“Ma’am I’m sorry but there’s nothing we ca — ”</p>

                <p>“Maybe it’s the carrier. It could be uncomfortable or broken somewhere.” The woman desperately tried to calm down her creature, carefully moving the carrier around and inspecting it.</p>

                <p>“Ma’am the rules — ”</p>

                <p>“YIPYIPYIPYIPYAPYIPYIPYIPYIPYAPYIPYIPYIPYIPYIP!”</p>

                <p>It must have felt like the whole plane was glaring at her. Peoples heads turned to focus on the yipping menace, frowns slowly morphing into open scowls and hushed grumbling.</p>

                <p>“Hey, it yapped twice.” Jackie smiled sheepishly. “Maybe it means it’s tiring out?”</p>

                <p>Franklin took a deep breath and leaned forwards to rest his face on the back of the headrest in front of him. The pressure was on the woman to find a solution as her dog went into a yip-yapping overdrive. The weight of the scorn soon grew too much to bear.</p>

                <p>“Hold on, maybe if I…” She unzipped the bag and a head poked out. A tiny little head with a pointed snout and a pair of triangular ears with white tufts shook itself free. The fluffy little dog with big brown eyes whined, muzzle dilating as he looked about. And in that moment, the scorn and frowns melted in a chorus of awww’s.</p>

                <p>“YIPYIPYIPYIPYAPYIPYIPYIPYIP!”</p>

                <p>Even with the continued yapping, only about half of the passengers found their enthusiasm dampened by the reminder that the dog, however cute it may have been, would be yapping constantly on the five-hour flight.</p>

                <p>“Ma’am, I’m sorry.” The flight attendant sighed. “You can’t let the dog out of the carrier. You’re going to have to exit the plane.”</p>

                <p>“What? But only his head got out!” The lady pointed at her dog in befuddlement.</p>

                <p>“I’m sorry, but it’s policy.” The flight attendant raised his arms in surrender as others began booing him. “Hey, I don’t make the rules!” He looked around now, the ire of the enraptured passengers shifting onto him.</p>

                <p>“We don’t mind, he’s a good boy!” Someone called out.</p>

                <p>There was a smattering of ‘yeah’ and nods until the hardened opposition made their own voices known.</p>

                <p>“Speak for yourself, I don’t want to listen to a mutt yapping for the whole flight!”</p>

                <p>More nods and yells of support rang throughout the plane.</p>

                <p>“YAPYAPYAPYIPYAP!”</p>

                <p>“You’re just a heartless dog-hater, just like the flight attendant!”</p>

                <p>“Woah!” The flight attendant shook his head vigorously. “I don’t hate dogs! It’s just policy not to have a dog loose on the plane!”</p>

                <p>“Yeah right!”</p>

                <p>“Get your dog-hating butt out of here!”</p>

                <p>More people joined in the jeers. Thankfully, he wasn’t alone.</p>

                <p>“Shut up, the guy’s just doing his job!”</p>

                <p>“Get the dog out of here!”</p>

                <p>Soon, the entire plane was in an uproar, people heckling one another on the dog’s right to fly or their right to have a flight that was only moderately uncomfortable. Amid the maelstrom of the dog’s yipping, the pro-dog and pro-quiet flight arguments melting into a cacophonic noise of arguments, Franklin groaned in pain as a migraine began to steadily form in his head. Jackie gently patted his back, pursing her lips as she struggled not to say anything.</p>

                <p>“Doggone.”</p>

                <p>The woman pushed her dog back into the carrier, though not without her own struggles as it wiggled and tussled about, trying desperately to keep its head outside and nose in the air. With a pull of the zipper, the cute little noisemaker was contained once again, and she hurried towards the exit. The hubbub died down as some people crossed their arms and pouted as others sat tall, satisfied that order and peace had won once more.</p>

                <p>A frazzled flight attendant closed the door and walked to the intercom, flinching at the hateful glares aimed in his direction. He held the intercom to his mouth, opening and closing it a few times as he struggled to find the words needed.</p>

                <p>“Listen, I love dogs. I have my own dogs back home.” He pulled out his wallet, opening it up to reveal a series of pictures unfolding down, each with a Labrador or a French bulldog in various cute poses that only the most seasoned dog lovers would have. “And it broke my heart to have the little cutie — and his owner — leave the plane. But there are rules on the plane. Even if you promise your dog is well-behaved, or its never happened before, they can’t leave their carrier. Not ever.” He sighed, shoulders slumping down. “We’d like to apologize for the delay and we hope you enjoy your flight.”</p>

                <p>He hung up the intercom and practically fell into his chair, leaning back like a man who’d returned from a war, like one who’d betrayed all his principles along the way. The passengers, somewhat mollified, settled down into an awkward silence. Jackie leaned closer to her boyfriend.</p>

                <p>“Maybe a few drinks won’t be a bad idea.”</p>

                <p>Franklin just hummed.</p>

                <p>“Never thought I’d see a civil war erupt on a plane like that.”</p>

                <p>“With me, on a plane?” Franklin mumbled as a wry laugh barked from his lips. “Anything’s possible.”</p>

                <p>The plane unlatched itself and began ferrying towards the runway. There were no more announcements. But the tension left by the dog remained. Every passenger knew they sat by their ideological rival, believing anyone else could be a heartless dog-hater, or a loud disturbance-lover. Just as the plane stared down the runway, preparing to accelerate its engines for liftoff, a small sound broke through the tense silence.</p>

                <p><i>“Mew.”</i></p>

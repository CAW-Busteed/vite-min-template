                <p>Just a few minutes ago, something broke. Not a bone, but a piece of myself that I carry with as much importance, oddly enough. My touch screen on my phone stopped working, accidentally sealing itself behind a weird double lockscreen that doesn’t accept my fingerprint. Even as I hold down my thumb on the power for minutes at a time, it refuses to reset. And I am lost.</p>

                <p>Getting a new phone is an annoyance, especially if your older model is broken. If you’re like me, you’ve got passwords, pictures, bookmarks, and contacts on your phone. And once its time to replace the phone, some of that stuff may not make it across. Maybe annoyance is an understatement. Because the cloud has proven to be unreliable in the past, I’m not expecting most of my stuff back. It enrages me in how much I need that annoying little rectangle, the very thing that feeds my anxiety and rage on a day-to-day basis. I need it to communicate with co-workers, catch up with family, try desperately to promote my stories online, reset passwords, read stories…navigate places I’ve never been to before, like a phone store for my carrier.</p>

                <p>Our cell phones are probably the best worst thing to happen to us, or maybe the worst best thing. Thanks to them, we’re always connected. Even if we’re away from work, we’re never away. The media we use to distract ourselves compete with one another to take up more and more of our attention, an avalanche of shows from streaming services, a deluge of hate-clicks and flame wars incited by social media, influencers and games vying for our attention. This constant war for our engagement strips us of our happiness, a pharmacy of opioids within our pockets we are all to eager to use when we’re bored. Standing in line, waiting for food, in public transport…liminal spaces where we can lose ourselves in our thoughts have been occupied by our screens.</p>

                <p>Yet, one’s own thought process, morals, and perception is so easily changed by the words of thousands of people online. Astroturfing by a wealthy minority is incredibly common. Opinions about movies, games, and art spawn lifelong feuds for the stupidest reasons. Liking something can become a bigger crime than outright lying about objective facts. At least with a conventional computer, you can walk away from it all to relax or leave the hot messes be. But with phones, you can’t walk away. It’s the buzz in your pocket, gently sliding down your thigh, beckoning you back into the maelstrom of bullshit and hate.</p>

                <p>We know we’re being spied on by our own phones. We know that every phone has some measure of planned obsolescence, a switch that goes off after warranty expires that makes the products worse, day by day. We know how the phones we carry make our lives more stressful, ruin our attention spans, and are full of apps actively designed to distract us in he most efficient manner. They are not made for us to be happy, nor to make our lives easier. They are carriers of adware and spyware, slim agents of misinformation and anger. Because an angry person is more engaged in a product than a happy person. And an engaged person is unable to see when they are being robbed. Robbed of our time, robbed of nature’s sanctity, robbed of our rights. All repackaged and sold to the highest bidder, so the next generation of tech can be sold to us for cheap money.</p>

                <p>I’m still going to buy another phone. Likely made from unethically sourced lithium, put together in uninhabitable sweatshops, wrapped in too much plastic, and rife with predatory programs. How else am I supposed to communicate with my family, be effective at work, get in touch with doctors? If I can’t navigate through society without a phone, what choice do I have?</p>

                <p>Dohremi had failed his mission. The Allmother had forgiven him, with a chance to win back her favor. A chance to use his gifts alongside his former siblings to save as many as they could during the Cataclysm. But, he’d failed. Many of those who had given him gifts had perished, and millions more hadn’t survived the great change. He hadn’t felt this terrible since her death.</p>

                <p>Dohremi reveled in a sigh. It was incredible how his perfect body could relieve his soul, albeit a miniscule amount, with a simple sigh. His previous self had been right to change. He looked over the flooded plains, myriad beasts and trees floating dead on its surface. Dohremi was disgusted at the beauty of a new ocean, clear enough to see the drowned grasses and trees, reflecting the reborn Sol’s light. Corpses hung suspended, most too ignorant of what had happened to leave any expression on their faces. He’d wished it was all. He could recognize the expressions of terror, of hopelessness etched on those who could understand what was occurring. Understand it was an end of everything they took for granted.</p>

                <p>The lone mountain he was on was now an island chittering with life. Mice, lizards, bats, oxen, and myriad other beasts he’d found and sheltered here at the behest of Arbora. He’d focused on the intelligent life first, but dug great scores into the mountain to keep in those who did not understand the danger they were in. That included a lot of the intelligent ones, those whose ancestors passed down tales of Dohremi’s crimes. The braver and more naïve were quite keen on him though; they crawled over him and rested between his horns as he lay down to sleep. Dohremi looked at his jagged claws. Once pristine and symmetrical, they were worn down from digging, preparing, working. Oddly enough, he’d felt a twinge of satisfaction at the imperfections, the scars not of a challenge or battle, but of hard work. He pulled at that pride and beat it down. He could have done better. Saved more. Prepared better by making a bigger mountain, or even a mountain range.</p>

                <p>On the horizon, gossamer wings sparkled. If Dohremi had to describe Fen, he’d say she looked like a cross between a ray, a jellyfish, and a butterfly. Six pairs of ethereal wings gently flapped, Sol’s light shining through her translucent body. She hovered before Dohremi, blue compound eyes looking at him curiously. Dohremi didn’t know how she always knew where he was, but he had his suspicions.</p>

                <p><b>“You’ve done well-l-l-l-l.”</b></p>

                <p>“Not well enough.” Dohremi was terse. With but a thought, he released the intelligent beings from his mountain prisons. “I should have made the mountain wider, not this tall.”</p>

                <p><b>“You expected the worst-st-st-st. So you made a mountain greater than any before it-t-t-t-t.” </b>Fen tried to comfort him.</p>

                <p>Dohremi turned back to look at the horizon. There was no land in sight, not even so high up. Just water reflecting white, and the bobbing black spots of the dead.</p>

                <p>“Is this what she wanted? A world of water to drown out any fire? My fire?”</p>

                <p><b>“This is just the new ocean-n-n-n-n. There are lands beyond the horizon-zon-zon.”</b>
                    Fen landed gently on the water, the lapping waves holding her nonexistent weight.
                    <b>“You are still too arrogant, brother-er-er-er.”</b></p>

                <p>“I am no longer your brother.” Dohremi shook his head. “But this ocean…it must take up most of Arbora’s surface.”</p>

                <p>Fen glowed pink as she trilled.</p>

                <p><b>“No, Arbora has simply grown more than before-fore-fore.”</b></p>

                <p>“How much bigger?”</p>

                <p>Fen’s flexible antennae sweeped up the baby tortoise resting on Dohremi’s snout.
                    <b>“In the time it would take you to reach Arbora’s deepest root from her highest branch, this little one would have sired three generations-s-s-s-s.”</b></p>

                <p>Dohremi was stunned into silence, and the watching beasts struggled to wrap their minds around the distance. “How can you be sure?”</p>

                <p><b>“I once had eyes everywhere-where-where. Now there is so much space between-een-een.”</b></p>

                <p>Fen placed the turtle beside Dohremi’s claws.
                    <b>“Now follow-ow-ow-ow. Arbora has heard your prayers for redemption and companionship-ship-ship. She has breathed life into a hundred of your stone eggs, the hundred of your wishes of what could have been-been-been.</b>”</p>

                <p>Dohremi’s wings twitched as his eyes narrowed. “Where is the test? Choose to abandon those I saved for a chance at sires?”</p>

                <p>Fen looked upon the greatest mountain in the world. Trees of various climes stratified into altitudes, myriad waterfalls, deep dens, food and space aplenty existed upon it. Dohremi could have made a barren mountain of stone, or a plateau. He could have made a simple mountain range with the same scenery and the same paths on every slope. But Dohremi worked hard to create a mountain unlike any other, one that would survive any Cataclysm and provide for all that lived there. It was idyllic, but not boring. It was dangerous, but not without opportunity. Where Dohremi once left scars upon Arbora’s surface, he’d now made something as beautiful as the heavens and as grand as the hells. It was an ode to everything Arbora had made for him, a reflection of the greatest he saw in the world and the Allmother that were one and the same. Nurturing and safe, yet strict and imposing. In Fen’s countless eyes, Dohremi had redeemed himself. But it was not up to her.</p>

                <p><b>“They will be safe here-ere-ere.” </b>
                    A tear trailed from her compound eye and trailed down an antenna onto the great oak tree that sheltered Dohremi’s den. It landed on a leaf, rolling still to nestle like a dew drop and blinked. Fen left an eye.
                    <b>“To achieve redemption, you must find the scattered eggs, and raise them as your own-own-own. Win your children as companions and redeem yourself-self-self.”</b></p>

                <p>“And what happens if I can’t find them all?” Dohremi began to gently remove the flora and fauna that resided on him.</p>

                <p><b>“After a Cataclysm, everything is hungry and desperate-ate-ate.”</b></p>

                “Then my punishment would be more guilt.” Dohremi chuffed, flexing his muscles. It would be an impossible task, even for Dohremi, to find one hundred eggs in an unfamiliar and massive environment. Arbora had set the task, but no rules.

                <p><b>“Would you like my help-p-p-p?”</b></p>

                <p>“You ask the mighty Dohremi if he needs help?” The dragon-god rumbled. “Then…please.”</p>

                <p>Leslie’s breath caught in his throat, tasting of copper and mud as he continued to run. His boots sunk deep into the bloodstained earth, but he continued to run. A branch exploded next to his head; a sniper shot that had missed him by a hair. Already the sound of gunfire grew louder as he weaved through the trees, the humid air sticking to his skin, his eyes, his very soul…</p>

                <p>Screams, curses, and yowls of pain echoed from the front, some in accented English, others in Japanese. Screams of agony said more than any language could. More horrifying still were the screams and cries cut off with a gunshot. Leslie heard the telltale whistling death and jumped to the ground.</p>

                <p>A mortar exploded a couple dozen meters away from him, shrapnel whizzing above his head. I have to keep moving, he thought, ears ringing. He jumped out of the muck and began running towards distant gunshots, pistol in hand. He crossed by a tree and saw a smaller man in that telltale green cap. Before the soldier had a chance to swing his rifle Leslie’s way, Leslie had already shot him twice with his sidearm. Used to the sensation of bile rising in his throat, he turned to what held the soldier’s attentions for so long. He felt his heart drop. Another medic lay there, desperately hanging onto his rifle with the last echoes of his life, his chest already a rusty brown of dead blood. One of the medics, Leslie remembered from the warnings given by his fellows that seemed to be given minutes ago. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, he resolutely began to run again. He was determined to not become the third dead medic.</p>

                <p>The ringing of his ears drowned out the cacophonous sounds of war, almost tricking him into believing this was simple uphill run. But there were no birds chirping, no rustling of leaves as a gentle wind danced through the glut of trees. That silence was more terrifying than anything else, a silence of death and decay just on the other side. Waiting for him. Every step up the hill, the ringing in his ears silenced and the sounds of battle grew louder.</p>

                <p>He came upon a clearing and once more. Bullets flew from every direction. Leslie ran through the hail of bullets, his vision focused on the small company of men wearing green combat helmets. Americans. One of them turned to look at him and cocked an eyebrow at the sight of the soggy digger’s hat the Australian medic wore. Leslie, out of breath, slid down next to them.</p>

                <p>“What are you doing here? The retreat has been called!”</p>

                <p>“Yeah, nah, there’s still some of you injured cunts up here!”</p>

                <p>Leslie and the Americans ducked as they heard another mortar but were surprised when it landed among the Japanese troops on the other side of the clearing.</p>

                <p>“None of us are seriously injured except Bryan!”</p>

                <p>“And where the fuck is Bryan?!”</p>

                <p>The American pointed to the middle of the clearing where a man lay, his back to a boulder, desperately cradling a broken rifle in his uninjured arm.</p>

                <p>“Fuck’s sake!” Leslie raged as he sat back up and began to run.</p>

                <p>In one moment he exited the underbrush and ran like mad. In the next, the Japanese troops began to concentrate fire on him. It was only a two second sprint to take cover behind the boulder, and yet it was the closest to death he’d been to all day. Considering how his day had gone, that was saying a lot.</p>

                <p>“Come on you, cunt.” Leslie said as the American gritted his teeth when he was heaved over the medic’s shoulder. “Let’s get out of here.”</p>

                <p>The American troops, seeing Leslie carrying Bryan, laid down suppressing fire. Steel, blood, and rage flew uphill in a torrent as Leslie began to run back to camp. His whole body ached, and his peripheral vision was reduced to a fuzzy edges. As he ran downhill an orchestra of violence following him. It was hard, carrying Bryan. Leslie wouldn’t abandon him. Like his parents. He passed a Japanese soldier, and out of options, threw his empty sidearm at the man’s head, stunning him. Another soldier tried to block him; gun raised.</p>

                <p>Just like football, Allen. Remember, you’re the Bull. Nothing can stop you.</p>

                <p>Leslie shoulder-checked the soldier, slamming the soldier down the hill and into a tree. Leslie heard yelling, but it was drowned out by the blood in his ears. Every time he slowed, he felt as if his legs would collapse under him. So he didn’t slow down. He passed by the dead medic, craters new and old, trees and mud soaked in the blood of soldiers from every part of the globe. Soon enough, he could no longer hear the gunshots nearby, but the beat of his heart served as a drumbeat to keep him running. He felt blood, he didn’t know whose, run down his legs, and a twisting, stinging pain in every part of his body that he could still feel. He didn’t see the other men looking at him in astonishment, nor the tents, except for one. The medical tent. He didn’t know how many trips he’d made. Five was more than he was willing to count, so he stopped after that.</p>

                <p>“One more bloke.” Leslie said, a bloodstained smile on his wide lips as his green eyes dimmed.</p>

                <p>He collapsed in the medical tent once Bryan was put on his own bed.</p>

                <p>Leslie “The Bull” Allen wouldn’t die there. He’d run through hell and back a dozen times — though some witnesses said more — and brought back twelve American soldiers, twelve who wouldn’t have gone back home had Leslie not been there.</p>

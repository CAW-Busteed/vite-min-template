                <p>Cold abandoned doll lays still,</p>
                <p>Repeating and repeating</p>
                <p>Functions without any will.</p>
                <p>Wooden doll stuck in cycles</p>
                <p>Dreaming dreams it canâ€™t fulfill.</p>
                <p>Frost creeping hollow within.</p>

                <br></br>

                <p>Ice feels like nothing inside,</p>
                <p>A void within, reflection</p>
                <p>Of all that exists outside.</p>
                <p>Being without affection,</p>
                <p>Soul stagnant, broken, bleeding.</p>
                <p>Puppet lacking direction.</p>

                <br>-</br>

                <p>Death seems like bliss to this doll,</p>
                <p>It shifts and changes to survive.</p>
                <p>Igniting the emptiness inside,</p>
                <p>He sets his dead heart ablaze.</p>
                <p>Ice turns to steam as the inferno grows,</p>
                <p>This wood doll became a wood man.</p>

                <br>-</br>

                <p>The fire accompanied him now,</p>
                <p>Blazing him forward into a light.</p>
                <p>The drive and energy it did endow</p>
                <p>The power and will to make things right.</p>
                <p>To be remembered, to do good was his vow.</p>
                <p>But the fire burned hot and bright.</p>

                <br>-</br>

                <p>Anger and rage fed the flame</p>
                <p>Hurting those he sought to aid.</p>
                <p>Fire gave strength he could not tame.</p>
                <p>Flaming soul heavy, a choice had to made.</p>
                <p>Burn to ash, leave naught but a terrible name?</p>
                <p>Or quench the heat, forgotten in cold shade?</p>

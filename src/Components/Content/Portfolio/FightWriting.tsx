                <Title className="order-2">Part 1: Matt Hughes vs Frank Trigg 2</Title>

                <p>The fight is on when we zoom onto the stage. We see the two fighters are pretty much identical in weight, height, and age. Trigg is leaning forwards against the fence, demeanor that of a big cat. Sort of reminds me of Scar from the Lion King. When his name is called, he gives a casual wave and goes back to leaning against the fence. Tense, or arrogant? Hughes is uneasily pacing, eyes on his opponent. He seems to have a worried expression, and he barely reacts when his name is called. The two come up, Trigg gets in his face, trying to intimidate him. Hughes pushes him away and they separate once more. Trigg blows him a kiss, trying to get him peeved.</p>

                <p>The bout begins and they ease up to one another. Hughes starts with a feint, but Trigg doesn’t answer. Trigg gives a few jabs of his own, one of which is swiped away. Hughes follows up with a feint and a high kick, but Trigg blocks easily. Hughes brings up a hand ready for a grab and launches a punch, getting a glancing hit. The two continue to dance like this until Hughes knees Trigg and backs off, only to come back a moment later with a straight punch to the head and a lunge for his legs. The two embrace, trying to push one another into an advantageous position, Trigg kneeing Hughes a few times. Hughes pushes him against the fence, tanking hits. Trigg manages to turn himself so their sides are against the fence and follows it up with a punch to the balls. Hughes is distracted when glancing to the ref for a call, and Trigg takes full advantage. He pushes Hughes off, and chases after him as he slinks away.</p>

                <p>Punch after punch, Hughes hits the ground, Trigg straddles him and starts beating down on him. Hughes tries to bring him down to his level while curling up to defend himself, but Trigg is elbowing his head into the ground. Pinned, Hughes receives blow after blow into his left side, and tries to push Trigg off with his legs, but Trigg just pushes the legs aside and goes for the neck. They’re against the ground still, Hughes is till pinned, but Trigg is unloading blow after blow into the back of Hughes’ head. Hughes locks his arm behind Trigg’s back, but Trigg is unfettered and continues to squirm for leverage with occasional elbows to Hughes’ crown. Unable to get out from the grip, Trigg settles with jabs to the sides of Hughes head. Hughes pushes against the ground to buck Trigg off, but Trigg simply keeps on top and sticks moves to get atop Hughes’ back, reminiscent of Hughes own victory against him in another match. Legs locked around his abdomen, Hughes receives solid blow after blow to his head, followed by a chokehold. Hughes struggles to break out, now Trigg is beneath him, and they roll over once more, Hughes carrying Trigg’s full weight on his back. Hughes’ face begins to go red. But in a quick turnaround, Hughes slips out of Trigg’s grip and goes back in to pick up Trigg by the abdomen, standing up as Trigg tries to break free. With a running start, he slams Trigg onto the ground and pins him, locking Trigg’s limbs. Then, Hughes straddles him and starts unleashing a torrent of hits on Trigg’s face as he desperately tries to defend. Trigg tries to push him away and roll over, but Hughes follows with his own chokehold, locking him in place until they are face to face once more, striking hard with his elbows. Trigg continues to try and slip away, but Trigg does not need as much leverage with his elbow blows. Trigg is still on the defensive and almost manages to escape Hughes’ grasp, but the man simply gets on his back again, using his weight to press down on him and taking the opportunity to punch him a few more times in the head. Just as he seems to relent, Trigg begins standing up, but Hughes locks him in place with a chokehold. Trigg taps out.</p>

                <p>Hughes remains champion.</p>

                <Title className="order-2">Part 2: Tanngris faces the Panther once more.</Title>

                <p>Tann held onto the atlas as he and his brother ran across the wooden suspension bridge that spanned across the deepwoods, their cloaks fluttering behind them. ‘Why would there be raiders here?’ He thought to himself, grimacing as he heard clashing wood and steel as flames cast long shadows in front of him. Tann bit his lip as the smell of slowly burning Neij wood brought back awful memories.</p>

                <p>“We need to split up,” Hollow said. “You’re far stealthier than me, and you don’t need to rest.”</p>

                <p>“I can fight.”</p>

                <p>“We’re not here to fight.” Hollow shook his head. “We’re here to get the atlas of the deepwoods to The Living Library. Realize that this could completely pay off our debt.”</p>

                <p>“I don’t think we’d lose if we fought them together.” Tann noted.</p>

                <p>It was true. Normal raiders would be no match for Hollow and Tann’s abilities. Separated, though…</p>

                <p>“Perhaps.” Hollow focused a hard look into Tann’s eyes. “But I doubt they came here without a plan. They came for the atlas. And if the atlas were to be damaged in battle, we’d all continue serving The Living Library for the next ten years.”</p>

                <p>Tann and Hollow looked back towards the village grown in the very tops of Neij trees, and saw a man fall from a platform, down, down, down into the darkness below. They heard his scream, and even heard pause to take a breath to continue screaming, but soon his cries of anguish were overwhelmed by the other sounds of battle. The two never heard him hit the ground.</p>

                <p>“All the raiders should know is that a Tribal managed to obtain the atlas.”</p>

                <p>Tann winced at the implication. It took a few years for them to realize it, but Tribal humans stuck out with their androgynous features and bright green eyes.</p>

                <p>“Fine. Remember, run if you must.” Tann said. Hollow nodded.</p>

                <p>“That is how we survive.” Hollow then smirked as he strung his longbow. “And we both know I’m a better shot.”</p>

                <p>“And who taught you the magic to make your arrows hit like a frenzied saurian?” Tann rolled his eyes and continued running.</p>

                <p>Soon, all that was heard was but a few echoes in the dark of the deepwood, and the rhythmic sound of Tann running across the wooden bridges. He spread his senses far out, relying on his meager understanding of aura to feel whenever people were coming his way before they could ever see him. It worked, though he still wished he had brought Honeydew along. His hummingbird familiar would have acted as a good scout, but the creatures the deepwood would make a quick snack of her.</p>

                <p>Carefully, Tann sent his aura to the balls of his feet to absorb any noise as he ducked past another patrol. It seemed as if Hollow was right; there were a lot of raiders. Probably all had heard word that the deepwood atlas was finally leaving its rune-laden repository, all hoping to get it and sell it off or use it for themselves. After all, a map of the floor of the deepwoods would allow anybody to travel while avoiding the limited bridges, the predator’s nests beneath, and acquire whatever treasures lay beneath. The deeper one went, the higher magic concentration, and thus better Neij wood and more mana-laden meat. Mages would kill their own families to go down there and absorb Arbora’s natural energies.</p>

                <p>Avoiding another raiding party, Tann followed a bridge deeper, towards a Neij wood growing platform. He recognized it by how the tree seemed to taper off into a flat platform as the branches grew from there in every which direction. There were still a few molds lying around where people would get the tree to grow into before sealing the mold and opening it. It really depended on where Neij wood grew that would depend on its properties, but it held a common factor: the wood was near indestructible without using magic. Great for growing houses, towns, tools, and weapons. For the site to be abandoned meant that the tree stopped growing at a rate that could keep up with demand or provided wood that was too flexible for growing tools. There were several bridges connected to it, making it a crossroads of sorts.</p>

                <p>Of course, the bridge behind him had to snap. Fuck.</p>

                <p>The other bridges began to fall down, and no matter how fast Tann rushed to them, they would be cut before he would get there. No bridges grown from the trees, a wide area. I’d say an ambush, but no sane person lets their victim know they’re about to be ambushed. Keeping calm, Tann focused his senses, but there was nobody there. Investigating the rope bridge that collapsed in front of him, he noted a clean cut through the ropes. Either this is a very capable archer sitting beyond my range, cutting off any chance at escape, or its that damn cat again. The panther had been stalking Tann for years now. Normally a predator would abandon the hunt, but it seems this one had become sapient by absorbing enough of Arbora’s energies. And it had developed a grudge. Tann thought he’d lost it three countries ago, before boarding the City of The Living Library and crossing Lilac on it.</p>

                <p>“Nowhere to run, prey.” Though maybe it wasn’t the panther. It couldn’t talk. “Not like the other times.”</p>

                <p>A figure seemed to blend out of the shadows. It was…Tann? No, it looked like Tann, had his features, but where Tann’s hair was brown and braided, this one’s was an unkempt, glossy black. Where Tann had green eyes, hazelnut skin, and a neutral disposition, this one had slit yellow eyes, the pink skin of a shaved cat, and prowled about like a hungry predator. In his hands, a spear of Neij wood, grown into a sharp point.</p>

                <p>Tann stepped back uneasily. He’d heard only stories of certain beasts Ascending, taking features of the elvenoids they’d studied the most; in the majority of cases by eating them. But none were supposed to be identical.</p>

                <p>“That look in your eyes…you recognize me.” The creature smirked, exposing his sharp teeth. “Good.”</p>

                <p>“Panther, I’m in the middle of something. I’m happy for you that you’ve Ascended and can now do whatever it is Ascended do, but right now, you’re in my way.”</p>

                <p>“The way I see it, you’re in mine.” He purred. “No prey has ever escaped me. None has hidden from me. And yet you’ve done so. Many times. I kept thinking over our every encounter, how you’d done it, memorizing your body, your actions, your very self. I will surpass you, return to my home and reign as apex once more.”</p>

                <p>“You have no reason to be here.”</p>

                <p>“To kill you is my reason. Why or how is of no consequence.”</p>

                <p>The two circled one another, Tann unclasping his cloak and wrapping the atlas in it before dropping it to the side.</p>

                <p>“Perhaps once I am done with you, I’ll go after the taller one of your tribe. The one that came into this forest with you.”</p>

                <p>Tann flinched, and took a step forward, unsheathing his bastard sword in his right hand. The two approached one another. And Tann lunged with a feint, but the panther refused to move. He struck forwards a few times with his spear, only for his jabs to be batted away. A beat. In a burst of motion, Tann closes the distance and slashes at the panther’s midsection, only for it to dodge and counterattack with a few strikes of wood. They stung, but Tann closed the distance, seeking to minimize the longer reach of his opponent’s weapon. Landing a few slices on the panther’s body, he yowled and slashed back with a free hand, morphing into claws that raked against Tann’s torso. The young man stumbled back. As the panther attacked, Tann heard something. A scream. Hollow? That was all the panther needed. He batted the bastard sword out of Tann’s hand and lunged forwards to run him through. Tann tried backing away and managed to only get a hole through his inner right thigh for his trouble. His legs unable to support the shock, he fell on his back. The panther abandoned his spear and straddled Tann, hands on his throat.</p>

                <p>“Remember this? This is how you escaped me last time!”</p>

                <p>Tann tried to escape the panther’s grip, but he was lacking air. He was panicking. Right leg burning from the injury, lungs feeling like they could explode, tears in his eyes. He tried punching him, but there were only glancing blows. Until Tann remembered something Hollow used to do to him when they were younger. Aiming closely, Tann’s hands came together, slamming into his doppelganger’s ears. The panther yowled in pain and released his grip just enough for Tann to slip out. Focusing his aura to his body, he stymied his bleeding and strengthened his body all at once, picking up the discombobulated panther by his midsection and throwing him against one of the bigger molds around them. Unsheathing his parrying knife, he leapt upon the panther. The beast was coiling about and tried to avoid his attacks, but he managed to stab him a few times in the arms and legs before striking him in the head a few times with the pommel.</p>

                <p>“I don’t want your territory!” Tann yelled in a half-dazed state.</p>

                <p>He didn’t want to kill the panther at first. It was just trying to eat, and Tann was all too aware of the importance of the biggest predators in habitats. He didn’t like killing sapient beings either, and this one was a bit too single-minded to be considered ‘experienced’ in being, well, self-aware. But it had stalked him, stole his face, and attacked him again. Nevertheless, he still had nothing to gain from taking a life, so he rambled on in an oxygen-deprived rant.</p>

                <p>“I never wanted it! You were the strongest thing in that damn jungle, and I was just passing by! Even now you feel offended by my escape! Get a fucking life!”</p>

                <p>“Guh,” the semi-conscious panther intoned.</p>

                <p>“You’re the apex predator, okay?” Tann wiped his brow. “You win, I surrender. Just…leave me and my tribe alone.”</p>

                <p>Tann sighed and went to pick up his sword and cloak.</p>

                <p>“Gack.”</p>

                <p>“Shut up.” Tann said as he passed his defeated opponent to pick up a rope he’d found laying around, tying it to one of the smaller molds and looking for a sturdy branch to throw it to.</p>

                <p>It took a few moments, but Tann managed to throw the mold into a rigid branch to swing across where a bridge used to be. And as he left the panther there, swinging towards where his family would be waiting for him, the panther-turned-human stirred.</p>

                <Title className="order-2">Part 3: Short Reflective Essay</Title>

                <p>What I got from the fight was that Trigg and Hughes came at one another with a history; moreover one where Trigg had less losses than Hughes, but Hughes had leagues more experience. Trigg also presented himself like a lithe cat, but with longer limbs, he had the reach that Hughes lacked. Hughes, however, seemed to come off as cautious compared to Trigg’s hyped up confidence, and carried himself as an endurance fighter. I tried to reflect this with Tann being indicative of a cautious, more experienced in the ways of life person, while the panther, whom has decided to call itself Apex, as a person with more reach (the spear) and aggression, even trying to psych Tann out at the start, as Trigg did Hughes. It was difficult to come up with a scenario where Tann would be distracted by an illegal move, so I tied it to the psych out that Hollow was in danger (Don’t worry, Hollow was just yelling as he chopped off some poor schmuck’s head). I was severely tempted to add background into the story, such as the history of human origin and why other sapient species don’t like them in this setting (Lilith, the mother of all humans, was created to parody the other bipedal mammalian races, which is why they’re referred to as elvenoids rather than humanoids), but that would have sidetracked from the main attraction: the fight! Anyways, the reversal of the situation mimics that of the fight, but I didn’t want to replicate the fight with every action, though I believe the choke I wrote was a good substitute for the hopeless situation Hughes found himself in. In the end, I wanted a reason for Apex to live because the two fighters seemed to leave on mutually respectful terms, so I put a spin on it. Despite Apex coming off as well spoken, he still acts mostly by childish instinct and tends to follow his emotions rather than the logic afforded by becoming sapient. Interesting stuff to explore. Anyways, this was necessary to replicate the sense of respect of two fighters after a hard-fought battle, while also fulfilling the potential for one more fight, just as I seemed to get from what Trigg wanted.</p>

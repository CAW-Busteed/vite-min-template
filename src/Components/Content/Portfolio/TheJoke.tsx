                <p>Settle down children, please. Sit down and drink from your bowls, as I’ve a story to tell you. This is an ancient story, older than me, older than my grandfather, and older even than his grandfather. This is a tale from before our current age, before Sun Auric broke the elven hegemony over the continent, and before even the elves had even dominated Midbark. This is how humanity came to be.</p>

                <p>Our story starts like so many others: with a pair who’d fallen in love. Now, unlike the stories you’ve heard before, one lover was the Primordial Nai. Her paramour, shy as they were, never revealed themselves, but one of their greatest gifts they had ever given Nai were the first elves. Glish, ever the competitive, created a similar race, the dwarves…Unknown to these Primordials, they had started something, much like the Sires of Dohremi had done before. Other gods and demons saw the dwarves and elves and were enamored, seeking to replicate the species with their own unique twists. Fen made the argites, beings who hunt in the plains with eyes on every part of their bodies. A god made the zenith-folk to honor Sol, and another made the duskin in Lun’s glory. Bjorn, still seeking Ord, made the goliaths to help him in his search. And so on, and so forth. A young god saw looked upon the elvenoids with scorn. Gwydionogi, god of Mockery.</p>

                <p>To emphasize his points on their inferiority, he’d made a variety of beasts in cruel reflections of the elvenoid races. From stone Gwydionogi carved apes; bonobos, gorillas, chimpanzees, monkeys, into which he breathed life. He’d laughed when other immortals witnessed his creations, but after a few centuries, none cared anymore. The creatures were beasts, intelligent beasts with a resemblance to elvenoids, but there had beasts resembling the sapient races before. Infuriated at having lost the attention of his peers, Gwydionogi sought to create the ultimate expression of ridicule. A thinking being of made in vicious jest, whose mere existence would provoke fury in the others for the mockery that they represented.</p>

                <p>Where elves had bones of ancient alder and dwarves had bones of mithril, his creation would have bones of limestone and ice. Where the elves had flesh of moonjade and dwarves had flesh of highbronze, his creation would have the flesh of soft clay. Gwydionogi crafted a body that was neither as tall and as beautiful as that of the elves, nor as short and solid as that of the dwarves. It was lacking any unique features. No prized antlers like that of the elves, no elaborate whiskers like that of the dwarves, no eyes like the argites, no massive jaws of the goliaths, nor even the wings of the duskin and zenith-folk. The doll was perfect in its mediocrity, resembling a stunted member of the other races.</p>

                <p>Gwydionogi struggled with the last ingredient, the blood.. Elves have blood of silverwood sap and ancient Arboran dew, animated by the breath of an unknown being. The dwarves have blood of quicksilver harnessed from Arbora’s core and the first drops of the most terrible storms, animated by Glish’s bellows…Yes, Tann, the very bellows that Glish used to forge the greatest weapons seen by mortal and immortal alike.</p>

                <p>Where was I? Oh right…</p>

                <p>The god of Mockery crushed a rusty dagger into an urn of river water, mixing it until he deemed the murky rust-water suitable. But it was not useless. Gwydionogi would need something that would cause his creation pain, something that pushed it towards destruction. He sought out the most powerful dragons, hoping beyond hope for anything. Dragons, being quite proud, would not allow the god of Mockery anywhere near them. All, save one, for whom time and pain had tempered into a patient and altruistic being. Dohremi, the first Dragon.</p>

                <p>“I beseech you, O great one!” Gwydionogi prostrated himself. “Allow me to have but a drop of your blood so that I may create something worthy of you!”</p>

                <p>Dohremi may have become kind, but he had not become stupid. He knew that Gwydionogi’s forked tongue was adept in half-truths and tricky fabrications.</p>

                <p>“What have you come to bargain, little god?” Dohremi rumbled.</p>

                <p>“The location of one of your eggs, unhatched.”</p>

                <p>Dohremi had only found twelve eggs millennia ago. To learn the location of one of the Lost Sires was imperative to him.</p>

                <p>Information and blood were the wagers. They played a game. Gwydionogi lost and told Dohremi:</p>

                <p>“I last saw it when I was mortal, by my village which sat at the mouth of the Twisting Serpent River.”</p>

                <p>“Gratitude.”</p>

                <p>“Would you like to know its current condition?” Gwydionogi asked in turn.</p>

                <p>“Is it not intact?” Dohremi growled.</p>

                <p>Gwydionogi smirked and offered a second bargain.</p>

                <p>“I will tell you…in a game for two drops of your blood.”</p>

                <p>They played another game. Gwydionogi lost once more.</p>

                <p>“It was not intact. I saw someone eat it.”</p>

                <p>“Who?” Dohremi rumbled in suppressed rage. “What fell beast would dare eat one of mine?”</p>

                <p>“I will tell you…in a game for three drops of your blood.”</p>

                <p>They played yet another game. This time, Gwydionogi won.</p>

                <p>Dohremi was incensed, but a deal was a deal. Remember that children, lest you make a promise with someone or something that has a tongue like Gwydionogi’s.</p>

                <p>The god of Mockery skittered away to finish his creation, leaving the god of Dragons helpless with the knowledge Gwydionogi had given him.</p>

                <p>All that was needed to animate the clay doll was the breath of life. Any powerful being can do so, but Gwydionogi wanted the act to be meaningless, yet meaningful. It needed to be unintended, grandiose, and ridiculous, all at once.</p>

                <p>The conniving god set his sight on Kidu, the Primordial who had breathed life into most beasts roaming Arbora. Kidu could not bear to kill anything, as he found majesty in every creature, appreciating their subtle processes and small lives. Gwydionogi used this to his advantage. He built abominable creatures that were equally frail as they were annoying. Horseflies, mosquitos, and rotters, tiny insects that would whine, bite, and stink. He unleashed a swarm where Kidu rested, letting the Primordial deal with the pests in the only manner he could. He waved his appendages, he cast magic, and he even tried to convince the swarm to leave. But the pests were stubborn, small, and stupid.</p>

                <p>Out of options, Kidu wished them good luck and blew a massive gale. Just as he breathed, Gwydionogi sprung in with the doll and let the breath subsume her. Before Kidu could realize what was going on, Gwydionogi ran away just as the doll began to open her eyes for the first time.</p>

                <p>Her first moments were chaos, but when Gwydionogi set her down, she fell to her knees. Her brittle bones could not completely support her weight, fracturing and sending spikes of pain throughout her body. Yet pain and turmoil was all she had known, and she looked upon the world in a calm gaze.</p>

                <p>“What am I?”</p>

                <p>The god was eager to explain his joke.</p>

                <p>“Bones of brittle limestone, flesh of soft clay. Blood of broken dagger, baked in dragon’s rage. Kidu breathed life into you, without his say. Dragon passion burns within, but your frail body is its cage.”</p>

                <p>“What does that make me?”</p>

                <p>And Gwydionogi named his creation an insult of an old era. Something useless. Waste.</p>

                <p>“You are untilled soil.”</p>

                <p><i>Uem Ahn.</i></p>

                <p>Child hatched from egg of wood,</p>
                <p>Carved from ancient tree’s heart,</p>
                <p>To explore green horizons,</p>
                <p>Bask in her divine first art.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Orchid Dragon, the tenth-reared,</p>
                <p>Kindest of his violent ilk,</p>
                <p>Heard a signing voice in a clearing</p>
                <p>Melodious chimes and soft as silk.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Upon a daisy, a fairy sat,</p>
                <p>Eyes like roses, wings of pink petal</p>
                <p>Swain by her mournful tune,</p>
                <p>His heart could not settle.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>“O fairy, why dost thou cry?</p>
                <p>Which creature must I make die?”</p>
                <p>The great dragon sat before her,</p>
                <p>Quieting her fear with a purr.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>She pointed to a tree branch,</p>
                <p>Snaking over the clearing.</p>
                <p>On it was a flower,</p>
                <p>Life-force disappearing.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>“Mine life is tied to that flower,</p>
                <p>Try as I might, it is dying.”</p>
                <p>The rainbow dahlia’s petals dull,</p>
                <p>Stem and leaves gray, quickly drying.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>“This shall not be!” the dragon proclaimed,</p>
                <p>He flew to find a spirit of rain.</p>
                <p>He brought it ‘fore the fairy,</p>
                <p>But the downpour was in vain.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The stem still drooped,</p>
                <p>Life still fading.</p>
                <p>The dragon did not give up,</p>
                <p>He would continue aiding!</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>He flew out again,</p>
                <p>And brought back a moon.</p>
                <p>When its gentle presence did not work,</p>
                <p>He caught a sun for its bright noon.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Yet the bloom continued dying,</p>
                <p>Spectrum of colors fading gray.</p>
                <p>Despite the Orchid Dragon’s power,</p>
                <p>The fairy would not see the next day.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>“Neither water, nor grace, nor light,</p>
                <p>Are helping this flower at all!”</p>
                <p>The dragon roared to the sky,</p>
                <p>“Are there any whom I could call?”</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The fairy continued to cry,</p>
                <p>The dragon desperately sought</p>
                <p>Any whom could stop this good-bye.</p>
                <p>Just as he thought it was for naught…</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>A small whisper reached them.</p>
                <p>“I can help, may I try?”</p>
                <p>’Twas a little toadstool,</p>
                <p>Hidden ‘neath stalks of rye.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The wise Orchid Dragon,</p>
                <p>Learned from father’s mistake.</p>
                <p>“What dost thou suggest, mushroom?”</p>
                <p>He bowed for the fairy’s sake.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>“Tear the branch from the tree</p>
                <p>Upon which the flower rests.</p>
                <p>Lay it by my side,</p>
                <p>To protect it from pests.”</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The dragon chopped without question,</p>
                <p>Upon her flower, fairy lay.</p>
                <p>She and her heart set by fungus,</p>
                <p>As they both began to flake away.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The small mushroom got to work,</p>
                <p>Breaking the branch into dirt.</p>
                <p>Protecting the flower’s roots,</p>
                <p>Back to life, it did revert.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The fairy’s life was not saved</p>
                <p>By the mighty and divine,</p>
                <p>But by the humble, the small,</p>
                <p>And the effort they combine.</p>

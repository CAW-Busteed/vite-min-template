                <p>A man looks upon his brother’s flock and seethes in jealousy. His brother has more land, more riches, and is lauded by people all around. He picks up a stone, examining its heft. He lures his brother away into solitude and bashes his head in. Blood flows between his fingers and when he stops slamming the rock upon what’s left of his brother’s head, he weeps. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A father kills and consumes his children, save the youngest, whom the mother saves. The youth grows up, nursing his rage. He slips into his father’s home as a servant and slips poison into his wine. As his father retches and vomits, the young man castrates him and kills him. The cycle repeats. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A woman refuses to marry the man her father had chosen for her. But he made a promise, and it must be upheld. Still, she refuses to give up her freedom. Her father carries her onto a boat in the frozen seas and canoes out until the white land in the horizon has receded to a freezing blue. The father throws her overboard, she screams. She begs. She cries. She attempts to climb back onto the canoe as her body starts to slow down, the cold water sapping her strength. Her frozen fingers clasp onto the boat, but her father refuses. He cuts off her frozen fingers and lets her sink. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A man woos a woman, hoping to seek her deepest depths. She refuses. He offers compliments, then money, then fame and glory. Still, she refuses. Angry, he threatens to hurt her if she doesn’t comply. After he is done, he kills her anyways. Her decapitated head had tears running down her face. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A man lives his whole life in his village. He was born there, he married there, he raised his children there. When he was old and weary, his village was declared to be a part of another country. His sons had died fighting these men. His money no longer has value, his customs outlawed, and his language dies with him, a sordid whisper on the deathbed of a destitute man. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A child is taken from his home. He is made to work for no pay, to be called upon like a common dog. He works and works and works and works and works. Eventually the child is a man. Yet he works and works and works and works and works. He has no choice. He has never known choice. Simply work or be beaten. These ultimatums are not choices, so he works until he dies, nameless and forgotten. That is violence.</p>

                <p>There is a battlefield, where brother fights against brother, neighbor against neighbor. Where kin are forced to fight, maim and kill one another over principles upheld by their leaders. The same leaders who sit in their chairs, sipping wine and living in luxury as blood is drawn in their name. They smile because their loved ones are safe, and their principles are being fought for. Should they lose, their enemy’s ‘honor’ will protect them, just as their own ‘honor’ will protect their supposed mortal foes. The only red they will ever see is the crimson within their glasses. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A man is locked in a dark room. Time passes for those outside, but nothing changes for him. One day, the warden comes to him for answers. He asks the prisoner a question, but he is unsatisfied with the answer. The prisoner is beaten. He asks again. Same answer. The prisoner is cut a hundred times. He asks again. Same answer. The prisoner is burned a thousand times. He asks again. Same answer. The prisoner is drowned, slapped, bitten, torn, humiliated, hurt, wounded, wacked…until he gives the warden the answer he wants to hear. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A man is on the hunt. He stalks a mighty beast, taking days following its tracks, investigating its scat. When he finds it, he takes it all in a moment and smiles. He has found his prey. He kills it, basking in the joy of the hunt. He doesn’t need the meat or the bones. Maybe somebody wants some of its ivory, but the rest of the mighty beast is left to rot. That is violence.</p>

                <p>There are other types of violence.</p>

                <p>A woman survives a traumatic series of events. Her mind heals, but the scars don’t fade. The numbers on her arm seems as blackened as the first day they were printed on her skin. She meets others in similar situations, from around the world. From the South, from the East, from the North, and even the ‘civilized’ west. She wakes up on the bus one day, after a long trip, overhearing some people talking about how those events never happened, how it was a lie. She stares at the number on her arm and hides it before they could see it. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A young man is walking with his friends when an officer stops him. His friends awkwardly look away while he is patted down. He is let go with a warning, despite doing nothing. He knows it will happen again, simply because of the color of his skin. That is violence.</p>

                <p>A damaged man falls in love with a woman. He spends time with her, and reveals his darkest secrets, his deepest insecurities, his most crippling weaknesses. Later, she uses these to make him do what she wants, and eventually they split apart. She knows what to say to reduce him to a sobbing mess as she leaves, content in her schadenfreude. That is violence.</p>

                <p>Nations wage campaigns to obtain more resources, more money, more power. They do not think of the future. They burn, they consume, they buy what the must to get ahead, and get stuck in their ways. They claim other ways are ‘against tradition’, ‘evil’, ‘unknown’…as the lands around them turn to desolate wastelands. That is violence.</p>

                <p>But when…</p>

                <p>A woman fights off the man who attempts to take what isn’t his, and she kills him to defend herself. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>A man takes away from those who have made too much off the backs of their serfs and servants, their people and their oppressed, only to redistribute the goods to those in need. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>A people roil and wreak damage to a system of powerful individuals, destroying a system in the name of equality, freedom, and the hope for a better tomorrow. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>A man hurts or even kills his fellows to defend the land and resources that sustain them all. He hopes it won’t happen again, but steels himself if need be. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>A mountain lion kills a docile doe to feed her cubs. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>A storm is a violent force that spreads chaos through civilizations. One kills thousands of people, but it nourishes the land, the trees the animals. It has destroyed, it has created, but it is incapable of thought. Is it violence?</p>

                <p>When the universe was young, massive forces worked together to mash together atoms on a colossal scale, forever changing the night sky. These massive forges of hydrogen and helium create everything that matters and burn with enough intensity to have jump-started basic life on our planet several billion years ago. Yet these lifeforms thrive on change and consumption to survive. What is life but the cycle of hunting and eating, of which only the autotrophs are innocent? Is existence itself for life violence?</p>

                <p>A man sits in a chair, wearing flip-flops, a green hoodie, and blue pajama bottoms. He sits on a chair produced by cheap labor through what is likely to be unethical means, on a computer made in a far-off country with toxic materials in equally unethical means. He is unsure, but he uses what he has. While everything he touches could be the product of violence, his initial thoughts are more visceral, mired in blood and betrayal, full of death and destruction. He asks himself “Is it violence?”</p>

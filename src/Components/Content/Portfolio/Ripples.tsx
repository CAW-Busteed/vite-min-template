                <p>It envelops my legs,</p>

                <p>Caressing up to my thighs.</p>

                <p>Distorting my shape,</p>

                <p>Tricking my eyes.</p>

                <p>I see a shadow at the bottom:</p>

                <p>Broad shoulders and a head.</p>

                <p>It waves back up to me,</p>

                <p>Then its shimmering arms spread.</p>

                <p>I just got closer,</p>

                <p>Taken by a cold embrace.</p>

                <p>My shadow is bigger now,</p>

                <p>Coils of light dance on my face.</p>

                <p>I can’t tell the difference</p>

                <p>My inside from my out,</p>

                <p>Spikes of frost crawl up and in,</p>

                <p>The shadow dances about.</p>

                <p>Up to my chest the meniscus shakes,</p>

                <p>I move about to keep warm.</p>

                <p>Whorls of light in shadow’s wake,</p>

                <p>Shifting and changing its form.</p>

                <p>I see his fingers,</p>

                <p>Counting down from five.</p>

                <p>Then four, three, two, one</p>

                <p>Towards him I dive.</p>

                <p>Breath leaving my mouth</p>

                <p>In cascades of bubbles silver-blue,</p>

                <p>So I can sink deeper, faster,</p>

                <p>Away from the dry for just a few.</p>

                <p>Flesh meets shadow,</p>

                <p>As it does on land.</p>

                <p>Hair dancing in currents,</p>

                <p>I smile and do a handstand.</p>

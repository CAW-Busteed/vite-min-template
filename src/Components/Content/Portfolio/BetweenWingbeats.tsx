                <p>The phone rang in a chirpy tune,</p>

                <p>A herald of the vulture on the other end.</p>

                <p>“I miss you,” she crowed,</p>

                <p>“Take me back,”</p>

                <p>He remembered the twinkling lights</p>

                <p>Reflected in her sweet chocolate eyes,</p>

                <p>Smile framed, lips like rose petals.</p>

                <p>Fire dancing in his chest,</p>

                <p>Fingers dancing, intertwining, clasping each other.</p>

                <p>Moonlit nights resting upon one another,</p>

                <p>Hazy dawn’s dew from heated breath.</p>

                <p>Birds of a feather built a nest together,</p>

                <p>Flying into one another’s embrace.</p>

                <p>Bodies separated joint as one come nightfall,</p>

                <p>Passion bright as daylight star,</p>

                <p>Faded into a heartbeat.</p>

                <p>Beating, beating, beating no longer as a war drum,</p>

                <p>But as a metronome,</p>

                <p>Unified, joined, in synchronization,</p>

                <p>Gears in motion, the tick-tocks beyond mere notion of some foreign emotion</p>

                <p>Striking the hour the two fly from the perch together</p>

                <p>Tender fingertips dance across her collarbone,</p>

                <p>Delicate whorls above and in her hair</p>

                <p>Promises chirped in the red dusk</p>

                <p>Kisses traded ‘neath different night skies.</p>

                <p>Return home, love reignited</p>

                <p>Not as hot, but constant and eternally needed,</p>

                <p>Union crumbling in a mind,</p>

                <p>Lies of youth, follies of tales,</p>

                <p>Deceived the magpie into longing for more.</p>

                <p>Gifts and trinkets aplenty,</p>

                <p>Failed to replace what she sought.</p>

                <p>Traces of another found,</p>

                <p>Canary’s sweet song began to fade away.</p>

                <p>Lied to and betrayed,</p>

                <p>He ran ‘way from the nest they built together,</p>

                <p>Cuckoo’s egg taking his place</p>

                <p>Escaping on broken wings,</p>

                <p>To build a new life.</p>

                <p>Lonely nights and dreary days,</p>

                <p>Failure at love blamed himself.</p>

                <p>Every dusk brings a new dawn,</p>

                <p>And soon he would fly again.</p>

                <p>Burnt by misplaced love,</p>

                <p>Bearing scar seen by many,</p>

                <p>He held his head high.</p>

                <p>The two canaries, once joined together</p>

                <p>Singing a song in crescendo,</p>

                <p>Changed and separated as the seasons passed.</p>

                <p>Swan’s ethereal beauty tempted</p>

                <p>The murder of crows swooped up their love</p>

                <p>Down shed, of a feather no more,</p>

                <p>One brought low by the illusions of youth sang by the minstels,</p>

                <p>The other grounded and burnt black,</p>

                <p>Black as a raven just before dawn,</p>

                <p>Charred by a flame he refused to let go.</p>

                <p>From his ashes rose another,</p>

                <p>Identical, yet different,</p>

                <p>Changed by fire as ore is refined by the furnace.</p>

                <p>Anger past long ago,</p>

                <p>Burnt to cinder alongside the smoldering remains of grief,</p>

                <p>New feathers grown to fly away,</p>

                <p>Wiser, better</p>

                <p>But she refused to let go.</p>

                <p>“Please,” she continued,</p>

                <p>Same breath hitched,</p>

                <p>Edge of a sob.</p>

                <p>He said one last word:</p>

                <p>“No.”</p>

                <p>When I was young, not so long ago</p>

                <p>I awoke with dreams of infinity.</p>

                <p>We would wake and reach for new destiny</p>

                <p>Reach, reach, reach far beyond divinity.</p>

                <br />

                <p>I did not know we grew old</p>

                <p>When we gave up on our dreams.</p>

                <p>Burdened and distracted we were,</p>

                <p>We could never climb beyond moonbeams.</p>

                <br />

                <p>“One small step for man,”</p>

                <p>We said, repeating and repeating,</p>

                <p>Masters of fractions of a dot</p>

                <p>Kept competing and competing.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Have we truly lost our way?</p>

                <p>Or have we never been on it at all?</p>

                <p>Could we not conceive a world so big?</p>

                <p>Or have we always been so small?</p>

                <br />

                <p>Cocoon of aluminum shrapnel</p>

                <p>Keeps us here on Earth.</p>

                <p>I fear the fire is dying,</p>

                <p>No more fuel for the hearth.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Stuck between autocrats and bureaucrats</p>

                <p>Bound by hubris and hate.</p>

                <p>Water rising to drown the rats</p>

                <p>We’ve been left to our fate.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Could’ve brought light to this universe</p>

                <p>Didn’t have to be alone.</p>

                <p>From blood and stone, we rose,</p>

                <p>Blood and discord are all we’ve known.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Nobody’s coming to save us</p>

                <p>Who’ll remember us when we fade away?</p>

                <p>Those sapient beings that will follow</p>

                <p>Etching legends of us in clay.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Because they, like us, are bound,</p>

                <p>To our cradle, to our grave.</p>

                <p>We’re but messages in sand,</p>

                <p>Washed away by time’s wave.</p>

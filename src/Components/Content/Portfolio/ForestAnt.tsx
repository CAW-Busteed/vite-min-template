                <p>Where are you going</p>
                <p>Curious little ant?</p>
                <p>In this forest, elbowing</p>
                <p>Past strange grass.</p>
                <p>I’ve been watching, blowing,</p>
                <p>Yet you hang firm,</p>
                <p>Oblivious and unknowing,</p>
                <p>Every step makes me squirm</p>
                <br />
                <p>“You will find no food here,”</p>
                <p>I declare with a knowing grin.</p>
                <p>I had not made myself clear.</p>
                <p>The forest moves, it shakes, it tumbles</p>
                <p>The ant continues to adhere.</p>
                <p>“I don’t want to hurt you, little ant,”</p>
                <p>“Things are not as they appear”</p>
                <p>Buried in underbrush, it doesn’t hear.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I wiggle, I dance, I flail,</p>
                <p>I do everything but wail,</p>
                <p>But that ant is stubborn as hell!</p>
                <br />
                <p>“Listen here, little guy.”</p>
                <p>I give him the stink-eye,</p>
                <p>Try to make him comply.</p>
                <br />
                <p>“Every life is precious, no matter how small,”</p>
                <p>“But you sir, have quite a lot of gall!”</p>
                <p>“You’ve crawled about, given me enough strife,”</p>
                <p>“To reconsider the value of your life.”</p>
                <br />
                <p>As I monologue and rant,</p>
                <p>Who crawls off my hairy arm,</p>
                <p>But that annoying little ant.</p>

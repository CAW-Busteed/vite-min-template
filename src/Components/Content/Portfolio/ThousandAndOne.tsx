                <p><i>Excerpt from Royal Historian Harim Dukesh’s Bloodlines and Inheritances of High Elf Royalty:</i></p>

                <p>We have covered the larger and more noble bloodlines but have yet to elucidate on how and why these lineages persist culturally and politically. These reasons persist to a bygone age, when the Sires of Dohremi still lived, when the Primordials began to learn from mortals. We elves were born, not out of a need to satisfy the egos of desiring dragons, but as an expression of love.</p>

                <p>No doubt you have heard tale of the thousand and one gifts; it is as ingrained in our culture as methods of horn care and horticulture. But these stories we tell our children as we settle down to sleep are based on historical fact. To reiterate, as there are few written accounts, our story begins with Nai.</p>

                <p>Nai, the Primordial, was a special case. Whereas the others of her kind lived as they pleased, she was dutiful to the Allmother by regularly expressing her reverence with gifts and actions in her honor. We hear tales of these exploits and see these monuments scattered across our lands. She carved the great Marbletree monument and carved upon its branches a hundred thousand poems describing the beauty of all that Arbora had given us. She fostered the Mangrove Island to become a haven and respite for all those lost at sea. She brought up the Deepwoods from her tears in remembrance of the species eradicated in the War of Heavens and Hells. She had created the Trees of Enlightenment, which bore golden fruit that would allow any mortal to understand the deepest intricacies of the Origin language. Beloved by all, but alone in her devotion, she had garnered the attention of two admirers. The first was obvious enough: Glish, enamored with the concepts invented by early civilizations, sought to court Nai to replicate the relationships he had seen between mortals. Nai, always the wiser of the two, did not reciprocate; how could beings as ancient and as powerful as they be confined to such base urges?</p>

                <p>The second admirer, we still do not know who or what they were. All that we know is that they started a set of events that would change the surface of Arbora forever. It began small, with Azulite Beetles. They would nest within the roots of the Marbletree and live out their whole lives climbing up it to eat encroaching moss and deposit beautiful minerals within the carved letters of the poems. This was the first gift. Glish, angered by the challenge, made his own gift: the Ruby Doves, which decorated their nests in the Marbletree with jewels and trinkets, feeding on the Azulite Beetles.</p>

                <p>And so, the two would compete for Nai’s affection. The unknown god made the albatross to guide the lost to the Mangrove Island, and Glish would make sharks to circle the island. The unknown god made glowpuffs so that people could navigate the darkest recesses of the Deepwoods, and Glish made darkstorms to consume light within. And so on, and so forth. Until the unknown god gave two gifts: The Silverwood, which hid the sought-after Trees of Enlightenment in groves of identical-looking willow but bore no seed, and the first of our kind, made in Nai’s image.</p>

                <p>Ten thousand high elves, destined to be stewards of the land. These elves woke from beneath the Silverwood trees fully grown, with the sacred mantra on their lips:</p>

                <p><i>“Bones of alder and flesh of pale jade, we wake to greet Arbora and Nai.”</i></p>

                <p>This first generation (oft called the Enlightened Elves to differentiate them from the high elves they spawned) lived in a symbiotic relationship with the Silverwoods, tending to and protecting the grove from intruders. In return, elves born beneath these Silverwood trees would absorb its power to become high elves, and upon their death, become Silverwood trees themselves. Without the trees, elves would have a reduced lifespan and lesser magic prowess, a fate reserved for exiled criminals.</p>

                <p>Glish attempted to beat his better, with three gifts: A mountain range to separate the Chroma continent from the reach of those living in Arbora’s branches, a vast valley to separate Chroma from the reach of those living in Arbora’s roots, and a race of short, stocky beings, with two thumbs on each hand and penchant for alcohol. Nai, ever gracious, allowed them to live in her grove, but the dwarves did not revere her as we did. They left for the mountains and valleys of their creator.</p>

                <p>As for the nobility among high elves, each line can be traced back to children born beneath the Silverwood trees left by the Enlightened Elves. The families that cared better for the Silverwood trees had their lines last longer as their sires would continue to benefit from the inherited power of the Enlightened Silverwoods.</p>

                <p>Note that certain bloodlines are more well-versed in certain abilities than others, with the most extreme example being of Priestess</p>

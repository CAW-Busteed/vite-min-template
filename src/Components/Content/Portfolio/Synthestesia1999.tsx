                <p>Lights blossomed in the night sky,</p>

                <p>Thunderbeating heart drowned out by spicy red fireworks.</p>

                <p>A torrent of people, gushing to and fro</p>

                <p>Cheering, celebrating, kissing</p>

                <p>Living the day I had lost</p>

                <p>Leaves an acrid taste in my mind</p>

                <p>“You don’t appreciate me,” She said. “You barely talk, you don’t show any emotions, and I feel as if you’re never there.” When I heard those words, my hands clenched my phone, knuckles white. “I’m leaving tonight. I’ve got a good job lined up on the west coast.”</p>

                <p>Voice muted by the dial tone,</p>

                <p>Burning aural incense of hair lit in a flame.</p>

                <p>Legs burning, perspiration and tears clouding my vision.</p>

                <p><i>How could she understand that those simple words felt akin to a vice in my heart, mere sound of her disapproval like rusty nails slithering under my skin? It is simple to say ‘I confuse my senses’, but to give meaning to such an idea would be unimaginable lest I imprint my memories onto hers.</i></p>

                <p>Crowds brim the streets</p>

                <p>Mind screaming in agony at every brief brush’s slithery scream,</p>

                <p>Skull resounding with every cacophonous sound</p>

                <p>The people disgusted me,</p>

                <p>A rancid palate of spoilt pig boiled in moldy alcohol,</p>

                <p>The smell of the loudness sent jolts of pain shudder throughout.</p>

                <p>Struggling to make it to the metro before she left.</p>

                <p><i>“Happy New Year!” And the artillery fire of champagne corks was like screwdrivers drilled underneath my fingernails. I could have turned back. Ran back home and rocked back and forth beneath my covers as I did every time this day came around. After all, this was the largest one ever.</i></p>

                <p>But no warrior would leave without his sword,</p>

                <p>No sailor without his compass,</p>

                <p>No blind man without his guide.</p>

                <p>She was my anchor,</p>

                <p>The center to this chaotic world that tossed me about like a butterfly in a storm.</p>

                <p>I took the silver necklace she gave me and rubbed my finger on it,</p>

                <p>The chiming smoothness interrupted by a subtly carved triskelia a mere tickle in this overstimulated world.</p>

                <p>I put the pendent in my mouth appreciating the taste of downy blue pillows</p>

                <p>And I continued to run.</p>

                <p>A trip, a fall into some unknown liquid and bliss was lost.</p>

                <p>The necklace fell from my grasp, bouncing into the gutter.</p>

                <p><i>We went out a couple years back, on an early morning trip through the local mall. Our hands clasped into a quiet melody of chimes and violins, when I saw the necklace that she liked, I waded through the February crowd to buy the gift, the buzz of people nothing but a small roiling mass that smelt of the sea as I waded through them. With her at my helm, I would not be pulled by this living undertow. Not a day later, she had gifted me a necklace of her own.</i></p>

                <p>Tears threatened to break out once more,</p>

                <p>Ducts yowling like a tortured cat,</p>

                <p>Legs huffed, a burning coal engine unwilling to be stopped,</p>

                <p>At their loud whistle they took me forwards</p>

                <p>Throat constricted, and stomach coiled at overstimulation,</p>

                <p>Bile rising up as I ran through the ticket station.</p>

                <p>The thought of her kept me sane,</p>

                <p>Skin as soft as a lullaby,</p>

                <p>Voice sweet as honey,</p>

                <p>Lips tasting of rosy velvet.</p>

                <p>And I rushed into the first train of the millennium,</p>

                <p>Collapsed before her bewildered eyes in an empty caboose</p>

                <p>As the world celebrated outside,</p>

                <p>We shared a moment in a grimy public transit,</p>

                <p>I said the softest, most fulfilling words that danced upon my tongue like sugar-sweet faeries</p>

                <p>“I love you.”</p>

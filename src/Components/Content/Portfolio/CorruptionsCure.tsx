                <p>Gilles felt the anxiety climb up his throat as he approached Xilaphis’s tower. It stood tall in the depths of the hot jungle, surrounded by trees that dared not mar the pristine ivory surface. The trees themselves were dozens of meters high, each bustling with life. Gilles passed a family of panthers lounging in a tree. The largest, a female, kept her golden eyes on him as he trod on the cobblestone path. There was a spark of intelligence in her eyes; she was awakened. Gilles shivered, all four of his arms tensing as his tail swept back and forth uneasily. Logically, he knew he was safe. Xilaphis had emphasized to the wildlife that the tower and the path leading to it were her territory. And no matter how ancient or powerful the panther was, she would not dare going against the sage. The tower itself was evidence of her power. The seventy-meter-long horn was not just a home, but a trophy ripped from the corpse of an ancient sea god.</p>

                <p>Gilles kept his eyes forwards and his pack close. Other awakened beasts and more exotic creatures became more prevalent as he got closer: A tufted elk ripped at a tree with its saber teeth, only to be grabbed by the errant tentacle of a near invisible cnidocyte floating on the ambient magic. A dire bear tore into some fruit as it eyed a similarly sized giant beetle. A host of spider crabs ate the parasites off an awakened, giant scorpion as it basked in the sun within a clearing. The scorpion’s gaze focused on Gilles, clicking its claws menacingly. Gilles felt his dragon blood boil at the provocation, but he quelled it. He was not going to be led by the dragonrage that had led so many of his kind down the path of discord and war. He was an enlightened mage, one who had competed with so many others to be given this chance to meet the scion of the Empire. He ignored the scorpion’s provocations and continued to the tower, trying not to stand and bask in awe. It was no wonder that so many beings gathered close to it. The air, the very space itself was suffused with power. Had he been more skilled in the arcane, he would have been able to glean what Concept the once-living god had attuned itself to. Perhaps one day, he could come back.</p>

                <p>He stood at the threshold; a hole bored into the thick ivory set with a pair of wooden doors. Gilles eyes widened. Someone had put a set of mundane doors, mere chestnut planks, at the entrance to the sage’s home! Shaking his head, he ignored the thought. Had Xilaphis wanted, she would have had them changed. There was no doubt some deeply conceptual reason for chestnut doors. He reminded himself to study chestnut when he returned to the Capital. Taking a deep breath, he knocked. He could hear the knock echo within and within moments, something pushed open the door.</p>

                <p>“Oink.”</p>

                <p>The boar was small, not even reaching up to Gilles’ waist. There was the spark of intelligence in its eyes, but it lacked the magic to have awakened on its own. A familiar? Xilaphis had chosen a simple boar as her familiar?</p>

                <p>“Excuse me, ser Boar.” Gilles curtsied properly, extending his four arms like the wings of a dragon. “Would you kindly let Xilaphis know I am here with her provisions?”</p>

                <p>The boar snorted and cocked its head, pointing its snout at the pack Gilles carried.</p>

                <p>“Yes, that is the package.”</p>

                <p>The boar chuffed and pawed at the ground as if to say ‘You can leave it with me.’</p>

                <p>“Ser Boar, I was told to give the package directly to Xilaphis.” Gilles said curtly, unwilling to say more.</p>

                <p>The boar sighed and motioned its head to follow. Gilles kept his lips over his teeth as to not show a forced smile through grit teeth. Following the boar, he was assaulted by its smell. And he could soon see why. The first floor was a literal pigsty. There was a small pond of mud, a pile of dirty furs the boar no doubt used as a bed, and plants growing inside! Gilles would have thought that Xilaphis let the pig run the place, had he not looked up. He gasped. Every few meters up, a platform was erected around the inside of the horn, complete with equipment, flasks, exotic materials, and books. So many books. The tower reached farther up than it did outside, every platform stacked high with books. Not even the College library had so many books. So enamored as he was, he did not notice something huge scurry in the darkness behind him. The creature moved about, its long body wrapping and weaving around piles of books, its six limbs grabbing onto the sturdiest points of the platforms, until it hung upside down, breathing into Gilles’ neck.</p>

                <p>Gilles’ quills stood on their ends. He jumped around, spell on his lips.</p>

                <p><i>“Acidic emission energy, go forth!”</i></p>

                <p>A bolt of caustic energy rocketed from his hands and towards the creature. The kirin swerved her body around like a snake, letting the magic spark harmlessly past her. And towards the books behind her. With a wave of her hand, the space shifted, diverting the four balls of magic into swirling upwards until they faded away to nothingness. Gilles was staring, openmouthed. She’d just cast space-distortion magic without saying anything. Maybe it was psionics? He’d heard the saurians were once quite skilled at it.</p>

                <p>Xilaphis, for that was who he’d nervously shot at, was still hanging upside-down. Three pairs of lenses floated by her bright blue eyes, oblong irises focused on the sheepish mage.</p>

                <p>“If you were an assassin, you would have kept attacking.” She noted as the rest of her body crawled down from the balcony, twisting her sinuous body around to keep her eyes on Gilles as she came upright. A quill and roll of parchment appeared in her hands as she began writing. Gilles found that her claws were filed down to soft points. He’d done that when he first studied to write faster, but it made him feel uncomfortable, as if he’d given up one of his last defenses. For a sage, he reasoned, claws may as well be useless. Her mane of quills was a mess, and her scales were unkempt and unpolished. The great sage looked more like a researcher than one of the strongest beings in the Empire. Oddly enough, Gilles found that comforting. As she wrote, her torso was kept straight, but the rest of her snake-like body wiggled and writhed as her legs shifted constantly. The boar, who was happily laying in the mud behind Xilaphis, gave a low squeal.</p>

                <p>“Ah, the package. Whatever happened to the last porter?” Xilaphis asked, never keeping her eyes away from the parchment she wrote on. Gilles was finally able to find his words. He prostrated himself.</p>

                <p>“Apologies for attacking you, sage Xilaphis. I was tense, and I deserve to be punished.”</p>

                <p>“Hmm?” Xilaphis’ snout left her parchment. “Oh, yes, whatever. Water under the bridge. I asked what happened to the last one?”</p>

                <p>“Water under the…?” Gilles shook himself and stood up. “He was last year’s valedictorian. I am this year’s. Did he not tell you that the privilege of bringing you what you requested from the Empire for your studies was given to the greatest mage-aspirant of the year?”</p>

                <p>“Hmm. That does explain some. And what happened to Kalless? My first porter?”</p>

                <p>“Ah, um…she started a clan. It appears she learned much from you.” Gilles did not want to say too much. Kalless and other, newer nobility, were currently clashing politically with the traditional nobles. There was tension all around and even talks of war on the horizon. Because a simple porter had learned too much from a sage, disrupting the careful balance. When she was forbidden from making more deliveries to Xilaphis, she had kicked up a fuss. But even her peers believed she had overstepped by monopolizing a sage’s wisdom.</p>

                <p>“She was always a good listener.” Xilaphis noted, a pair of lenses floating from the sides of her head to the front of her eyes. “Now, let’s see what you brought me, little reptid.”</p>

                <p>Gilles pulled out a few things from his pack. Some crystals, preserved organs and limbs of rare creatures, various phials of liquid, and a heavy box of compacted gold. It was the latter that was the heaviest to carry all this way, apparently something Xilaphis had specifically requested arrive with precedence above all others. He wasn’t told what was in it, but the headmaster had given it wide berth.</p>

                <p>Xilaphis needed only one hand to pick up the several hundred kilograms of gold compacted to the size of a small lockbox. The lenses lined in front of her eyes, and she squinted at the box.</p>

                <p>“I’m glad you got here when you did. Had you taken another week, the seal would have been compromised.” She traced a finger across the gold. “No doubt some brave souls were sacrificed to get this to me.” She said morosely.</p>

                <p>It felt as if an anticipatory bramble of thorns had grown around Gilles’ twin hearts. Xilaphis’s gaze focused on him, lenses distorting her eyes until all he could see was a storm of blue and complex emotions, a mix of curiosity, duty, and a deep sadness. Gilles found himself lost in those lenses, seeing something that wasn’t there.</p>

                <p>“You are curious.” It wasn’t a question, but an assertation of a fact. “Curious, afraid, and so much more.” Gilles was taken aback. The lenses allowed the sage to peer into his very soul and allowed him a glimpse into her own. How much had she seen? “Very well.”</p>

                <p>With a wave of her fingers, the stone beneath their feet was pulled upwards. As they passed each floor, Gilles imprinted everything on his mind. Several smaller spherical stones orbiting a larger one. Diagrams and equations he could not hope to understand without years of study. Strange gasses reacting with one another in glass tubes. Pieces of Gestalt technomagic, taken apart with floating diagrams of light pointing to specific sections. A crystal that played a haunting melody that followed them upwards. Thankfully, Xilaphis seemed eager to explain.</p>

                <p>“I was studying gravity here, it helped me create this platform. My corvid friend suggested the name ‘elevator’ but I doubt the term will propagate. Did you know that in a true vacuum, with the laws of reality as they are now, worlds would form into spheres rather than a tree? And those diagrams? That’s something I still haven’t completely understood. The relationship between time and space definitely exists, but I have yet to determine how. Those are some interesting gasses I found in some hypoxic and caustic regions. And I pulled those from some ruins not a month ago. I suggest you don’t look at — too late, now you’ve got a parasaurotops melody stuck in your head. I think its fascinating how despite their incredibly martial society, they’ve touched on the aspects of the soul. Some texts suggest that it was not my tortle ancestors that came up with the soul magic to form familiar bonds, but the parasaurotops. It may account for how long they lasted during the War of Heavens and Hells.”</p>

                <p>Gilles wanted to say it was ridiculous. The parasurotops were knuckle-dragging idiots who seemed to prefer wrestling over building a civilization. Some of Gilles’ peers, and sometimes Gilles himself, believed that their extinction was predetermined. The platform stopped. And Gilles froze when he saw what was sitting on Xilaphis’ desk. Another relic predating the War of Heavens and Hells. But this one was alive, and confined within three concentric spheres of thick glass. It turned towards them and hissed, its uneven chitin teeth opening up to release spittle of acid and spores. A mycanoid. Gilles was rooted to the ‘elevator’, but the sage simply pulled him along with her unnatural strength.</p>

                <p>“No doubt you’ve noticed a theme in my studies.” Xilaphis hummed, looking up at the floating bubble. “And you’ve heard of what I’ve done for the Empire. Or not, if the Ministry of Information has decided to ignore my complaints about censorship. What do you know about the War of Heavens and Hells?”</p>

                <p>Giles swallowed. “I know that that thing should have been destroyed. Mycanoids took over more of Arbora’s surface than even the Empire has. It accelerated the war between not just the different factions of the dragonborn, but between the dragonborn and the Gestalts.”</p>

                <p>“I was hoping you would tell me what you knew of the consequences. Those that still exist to this day.”</p>

                <p>“There was She Who Was Devoured, who wielded an axe that could cut through anything. And there is the Fallen Heaven Event, when she cut through one of Arbora’s branches, causing it to land on Her roots and starting the Cataclysm.” Gilles eyes widened as he watched as Xilaphis hold up the box of compacted gold. “No. I was carrying…”</p>

                <p>“The only things that have shown to slow down the Corruption of the fallen branch are distance, gravity, and heavy undegradable metals like gold. Slow, but never stop. And now we will see how the corruption fares against the most prolific, infectious being Arbora had ever known.”</p>

                <p>Gilles felt the space warp inside the box and the innermost glass sphere at the same time. There was a mass of fleshy material. It had subsumed the gold into its puckered, red flesh. When it landed by the mycanoid, the living mushroom hissed and spat onto it. The hating flesh did not react, only oozing closer to it. The mycanoid kept spitting spores and bile on it, but as the spores grew at a rapid pace, the flesh subsumed it too, adding it to its growing, cancerous mass. The mycanoid hissed, even as the ooze swallowed it, trying to use its teeth to tear into the mass. Every chunk it tore out stuck to it, absorbed into it, until the mycanoid was assimilated completely. The monster that knew no fear could not understand that fear was the right response. There was no winning against the Corruption.</p>

                <p>“As I thought, the life force of the Corruption is too strong.” Xilaphis sighed, writing notes in he parchment. The Corrupted mycanoid slowly turned its ‘head’ towards them once more. Rather than wasting energy hissing, it beat its chitin teeth against the glass repeatedly, until the chitin broke. But the chitin was reassimilated into the red mass and regrown again. And the corruption started again. It took longer for the chitin teeth to break this time. But now there were scratches. “In fact, the Corruption has inherited the mycanoid’s tenacity. It is fortunate no mycanoids have been subsumed by the corruption yet. Hmmm.”</p>

                <p>“Sage.” Gilles’ voice quivered. “How are you going to get rid of it now?” There was a snap as one of the bubbles fractured. “Am…am I supposed to carry this to the Wastelands?”</p>

                <p>“What? No!” The kirin scoffed. “I wouldn’t condemn you to your death, no matter what I saw within you…I’m just wondering if my idea will work. I had suspected the Corruption would do this; it is, after all, an offshoot of Arbora Herself. It is rife with the Concept of life, of survival, much like Arbora. But the opposite of corrupted life is not any living being.”</p>

                <p>Xilaphis held her hands together, forming the shape of a spade in between her fingers. She held it up to the spheres and chanted. The conceptual energies thrashed around her, Gilles’ mind struggling to comprehend the words of Truth that Xilaphis had chosen to bear towards the Corruption. It was only when he concentrated, both on himself and world outside, that he could finally understand with his whole being, the last of Xilaphis’s chant.</p>

                <p><i>“ — Just as death consumes life, let the undeath consume the unlife before me.”</i></p>

                <p>A gas that was not a gas filled up the container. Staring at it filled Gilles with the type of existential dread that only existed on the darkest, loneliest nights, when neither Sol or Lun traveled their sky. It was an abomination, the opposite of an opposite, that which should not exist. Just by watching it, he could feel his body ache and the soul start to leave his body. The gray cloud caused the corruption to atrophy and gray, until all that was left was dust.</p>

                <p>“Begone!” The sage dispelled the magic. Her scales looked duller, her mane more unkempt. “I call it Remorsum. There is a price to this magic, one that saps the life of its caster.” She sighed, her body coiling around Gilles. She was close, but not close enough to touch. “Now, I want you to promise you will never use or teach the magic I showed you, unless the Empire is in grave danger.” She grabbed two of his arms, her dull claws digging into his flesh and drawing blood. “Am I clear?”</p>

                <p>Gilles, his mind still on the gravity of what he’d seen, swallowed and prayed his ambitions would allow him to do so.</p>

                <p>“I promise.”</p>
